"I’ve owned a smartwatch before, but at the end of the day, I’m a watch guy and I really appreciate having something beautifully made that will last the rest of my life on my wrist. I also find notifications intrusive enough on my phone and don’t need another medium by which I can be contacted. I also like not having additional data points collected on me at (nearly) all times.",enunciate-candelabra,506,0,2023-01-25 11:48:55,Apple Watch
"Personally, for me, it was the battery life. I tried a Samsung galaxy watch afterwards and while the battery life was better, it still wasn't for me. I use an Amazfit gtr 3 now and charge it maybe once a month. I still get the notifications I want to see, step counter, exercise tracking, etc. I've also used past models from Amazfit and really liked them.",bottledmoons,31,0,2023-01-25 14:06:36,Apple Watch
"One year after I got my Apple Watch SE, the logic board went out, according to the apple store, was stuck in a boot loop, then the touch screen stopped responding. I’ve been wearing my Series Zero for now.  I’m switching back to a Suunto Traverse. 

I need the water and dust protection, and the message notifications. I work in a fab shop and my hands are usually covered in oil or metal dust. Can’t keep reaching into my pocket every time my phone dings.

The rumors about the Ultra being like a g-shock with a monster battery were super exciting to me, but what they released was just “meh”. 

There aren’t really any tough smartwatches that fit my checklist. Its fine…",ColbyAndrew,35,0,2023-01-25 12:02:44,Apple Watch
"Before I retired from doing triathlons I preferred using Garmin’s smart watches. Then I got my first Apple Watch, 3rd generation I believe, and enjoyed most everything about it except battery life. I used to charge my Garmin watches no more than twice a week unless I tracked a half Ironman race. My Apple Watch never made it more than about 26 hours, much less if I tracked a bike ride or swim.

Also, if I wear contacts I need readers to see the Apple Watch screen. That’s just me being old.

These days I wear one of several analog divers I own. I have all the “smart watch” functionality I really need on my phone which mostly never leaves my side.",cuisinart-hatrack,58,0,2023-01-25 11:53:40,Apple Watch

"I've personally owned 3 Apple Watches now; and I do occasionally wear it for days at a time; but overall I find it intrusive and not beneficial in any practical way. It's still baffling to me that they aren't mirroring the notification sounds that apps use on the iPhone, having the same generic sound for everything except SMS/iMessages dramatically reduces the value of it if I still have to glance down every time to see what the notification is. Plus I have actual nice watches that I'd much rather wear, so the Apple Watch often gets left aside.",Nikiaf,9,0,2023-01-25 14:12:33,Apple Watch

"I did this two years ago, got tired of notifications, never ending motivation  (circles are well designed) to move more and constant temptations to upgrade. Will get one nice mechanical watch and I will save fortune - I thought. 

Forward two years I have spent small fortune on mechanical watches. Stopped moving that much and recent health issue showed how much the data from AW can give me back. Today I sport Ultra and am back. Notifications tuned down, most dials are simple strictly for telling time and so far I can live with it. Battery life is amazing.",[deleted],80,0,2023-01-25 12:55:13,Apple Watch
"Hi, Ultra owner here.

To be frank, I feel like an idiot for falling for Apple's marketing for the Ultra.

Aside from the reasons you listed (I forget about it and it's another object to manage), the Ultra is severely limited for actual outdoor activities. The waypoint feature is cumbersome and doesn't work half the time, and the backtrack feature is the same.

But the most asinine thing about a watch marketed for outdoors/excursion types (me) is the LACK OF NATIVE OFFLINE MAPPING. This is absolutely insane. How can Apple compete with Google Maps (which has had a great offline feature for years) and yet force you to use Apple Maps on the watch? WorkOutdoors is kind of a solution but there are a lot of limitations.

In short: Apple forces you to use Apple Maps on the watch without providing offline mapping. How this passed QA is beyond me. You can use Google Maps, but the route has to be preloaded/active from your phone and you can't access the map. 

Aside from the Ultra marketing gimmicks, I do find it more stressful than fun to have another device to manage. There are times I forget to put it on. To sum it up in one word: the Apple Watch feels *redundant*.",[deleted],46,0,2023-01-25 18:17:41,Apple Watch
"Abysmal Apple Watch battery life pretty much forced me back to regular old watch. 

My expectation would be a battery that would last at least 48 hours (versus the AW's usual \~14 hrs).",1millerce1,75,0,2023-01-25 12:31:19,Apple Watch
"I used to have a watch but I got rid of it and never brought another one. When my phone is in my pocket I can instantly tell which app a notification is coming from due to the sound, eg Discord, Messenger, Shopify, Snapchat. With Apple Watch they all sound exactly the same. I have to physically check my watch every single time to make sure it’s not something important, instead of knowing instantly without the watch. So wtf is the point of the watch? It just makes the whole notification experience much worse whenever you’re wearing it. All my other products are Apple but I will not buy another one until they fix the notifications to be like iPhone. If one of the main selling points is “notifications on your wrist” then at least make it a good experience.",WideAgency2242,14,0,2023-01-25 13:32:41,Apple Watch
I got a Tudor and it’s just too damn nice to consider wearing my Apple Watch any more,WilliamMButtlicker,7,0,2023-01-25 15:44:29,Apple Watch
"Because, especially with long sleeve shirts and coats that I need about 70% of the time in my country, the pointy glass bottom with the sensor in the Watch really hurt my wrist area. 

Also when I tried sleeping with it, it was annoying, obtrusive and again hurt my wrist. 

Long sleeve coats with tight ends around the hand areas make the Watch unusable too. It’s quite annoying to push that all back to access the watch. 

Also not being able to update it any more (because of low storage) ended my use with it.",DutchMitchell,18,0,2023-01-25 13:45:36,Apple Watch
"I had an Apple Watch, a few times but could not get on with it long term.

1. As someone with ADHD I found it extremely distracting with the constant notifications
2. I got fed up of charging it all the time
3. I have a nice Tag I bought myself a few years ago. I ultimately would rather wear that, which I do",Difficult_Damage_958,16,0,2023-01-25 13:57:08,Apple Watch
"Recently decided to stop wearing mine. It’s insidious. I was roped in with feelings of “I’ll be able to track my health” I’ll have “silent morning vibration alarms”, “I’ll check my phone less” etc etc.

The reality is until I took it off and switched back to my simple classic Tissot, I didn’t realize how trapped in that Apple Watch had me feeling. Turns out I went 20+ years never knowing a fuck about my heart rate and I’m perfectly fine; I don’t need a watch constantly telling me. It’s not bad, it’s just useless information once you really think about it. 

It has felt amazing to no longer get notifications on my wrist. I had notifications turned off for all non essential apps already but even then I missed the convenience of “sorry! Didn’t see your text— my phone was away from me!”. Once people know you have an Apple Watch, they expect that you saw their message immediately no matter what.

Silent morning alarms? Literally just started going to bed and waking up at consistent times and I don’t even need any alarm anymore. Better than a silent alarm is needing no alarm. I have the regular one on my phone in case of an emergency but 98% of the time I’m naturally awake now +/- 20 minutes from when I want to be up. 

Just all in all it has felt so freeing to not be so plugged in all the time now. I’ll still put it on when I go workout so I can see what heart rate zone I’m in or estimate my calories burned, but I can honestly tell I don’t really need it there either.

Its also just straight up not attractive. I’m sorry but if you find it to be a good looking WATCH (not tech) you haven’t seen enough watches. I have a gorgeous Tissot for half the price of the Apple Watch that looks like it’d be 5x more expensive and is just fun to look at when I see it on my wrist. Something about actual depth in the dial makes glancing at the time on an actual watch faster and more fun too I can’t explain it.

Just my experiencez",redbricktuta,18,0,2023-01-25 18:26:31,Apple Watch
"So I worked for Apple when the watch came out, and we got a very nice discount, so naturally I got one. I wore it until it because incredibly slow, and never ended up upgrading. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago, I was leaving the company, and decided to take advantage of my last discounts. I do use it at least every day that I am at work, as I use it specifically for notifications. I was missing calls a lot before, I also have it set to only send notifications about calls and texts, everything else is off, as I have pretty gnarly adhd. 

Taking a 3-4 year break from it was so nice, but I do find it to be very useful.",emu222,4,0,2023-01-25 16:04:35,Apple Watch
"If I didn’t need it to monitor some health-related things I never would have got it. Outside of health monitoring it’s currently a $400 weather checker. I don’t think I jive with the “oh it’s nice to get notifications on your watch so you know when to pick up your phone” since I just turn off almost all notifications on my phone anyway and rely on badges during my breaks to check for new messages.

"I had (have) an Apple Watch 3 that frustrated the hell out of me. I had to completely reset the watch and delete all apps and data to perform even the most minor system update. The watch’s battery lasted lasts less that a day. I gave up, and on a whim, bought a $25 Wyze smart watch. Yes, that’s $25. I’m now in year 2+ with my Wyze watch and it’s awesome. 2+ weeks of battery life and notifications from my iPhone.  No, it doesn’t have maps or gps and won’t control my podcasts, but I am absolutely happy with the benefits vs. the pain-in-the-ass of the Apple Watch.

"I don’t have one. I’ve never had one. Apple is the reason I stopped wearing a watch in the first place. Once I always had a clock in my pocket or within arm’s reach, I no longer needed a watch. 

I keep notifications turned off for most apps. I leave my phone on my kitchen counter when I’m at home and moving around my house. I leave my phone on my desk when I’m at work and moving around my office. I want less connection to my devices and fewer disruptions, not more. 

Everyone I know who has one is constantly fidgeting with them. They will break eye contact during a conversation to check a notification. They will stop talking to the person standing right in front of them to reply to a text instead. 

As a person who puts my phone in my pocket or flips it upside down on my table whenever a person walks into a room so that person knows they have my full attention, I have grown to hate the sight of a connected watch on anyone’s wrist.",0000GKP,17,0,2023-01-25 12:45:44,Apple Watch

"I didn't find it useful.  I almost always have my phone on or near me. So being able to look at my wrist for a notification wasn't ""saving"" that much time when I could just look at my phone.  I could maybe see some use in getting an Apple Watch with cell service as I could leave my phone and still get basic notification, but not at the price Apple wants for the watch.

Also, battery life is a big thing as well.  If I've got to charge it every day, but want to use it for both sleep tracking and activity tracking/notifications.. when do I charge it? I'll get more interested in Apple Watch when they can make the battery last 2-3 days in real world usage without having to charge it.",deja_geek,3,0,2023-01-25 15:15:51,Apple Watch
"I just got one. I’m a mechanical watch guy and have a few on rotation. Finally got Apple Watch to really force myself to focus on health.

Apart from fitness needs, I don’t really see any value in this watch. It is really pretty, well done and light on the wrist. Tells time well with many cool faces and complications that truly are next level but that’s all it does really well.

If I were to not focus on fitness or track my sleep etc, I wouldn’t get this as I like my other pieces more in terms of their tactility and general affordances.",kalasipaee,3,0,2023-01-25 15:27:53,Apple Watch

"I have an old series 1 that I use for fitness.

When it goes, I won't get another.

I'd rather wear a regular watch and just have one for exercise, so I'll get a dedicated sports watch.

I don't like that the Watch tries to be a mini iPhone on your wrist. I don't want these on my watch:

* **Contacts** (no option to get these off the watch)
* **Email** (no option to not sync your default account)
* And having to actively monitor which **notifications** are being pushed to my Watch if I install apps. Basically, Apple assumes that if you have a Watch, you love notifications.
* Nor do I want turn by turn haptic taps and maps flashing up on my wrist if I'm using **Apple Maps** (especially when I'm driving because that's not distracting is it?). Yes you can stop it from doing that, but it's a little bit obscure to turn it off. Again, the assumption is I love notifications on my watch.

I might buy an Apple Watch in the future though if it turns into a more ambient health monitoring devices (or you can easily make it do that).

But I hate that it is essentially a marketing device to remind you how awesome it is to have an iPhone.",Professional-Dish324,3,0,2023-01-25 16:02:41,Apple Watch

"I have an iPhone and a macbook but can't seem to get my self an apple watch. I'm not sure if it has to do with the fact that I don't wear normal watches or the cost of the watch does not justify the means.

"My wife got rid of hers to get a garmin. I’m sure it’s highly personal, but she hates getting notifications. She hated having to opt-out of notifications. In garmin, it’s pretty minimal. Also, she’s not good at charging things. The fact that Apple Watches last only a day didn’t work for her. Also, she’s not very tech savvy, so it was too much tech stuff for her. 

Garmin worked great for her due to its simplicity, long battery life, and her outdoor hobby stuff.",tealicious99,3,0,2023-01-25 17:06:11,Apple Watch
"I have never had an Apple Watch, but I have had a few fitbits, moto 360, Fossil's version,  as well as a Garmin Fenix 6S.

I have worn watches most of my life so I have always felt naked without one. However, I ditched my smartwatches and just went back to a classic watch.

For me, it was honestly ""notification fatigue"" and feeling like I could never truly disconnect. Then there is the fact that you have to charge them (some need charging daily...my Fenix would last about 15 days). It was just another charger I had to lug around and plug in when I traveled, and just became annoying after awhile.

My previous job, I managed the IT department for a bank and reported directly to the COO. He would not allow people to wear smart watches at the office. When you are talking to someone and keep looking at your wrist, it often times gives the impression that you have to (or want to) be somewhere else. This part I do get, because it is a little annoying when we are out with friends and they are looking at their watch every 10-15 minutes.",AgentAaron,3,0,2023-01-25 17:24:56,Apple Watch
"I got rid of the Apple Watch. Two reasons:

\- notifications were really pissing me off - too many notifications, which I started to turn off one by one until I was getting almost no notifications. Notifications are disturbing for family life, I couldn't focus on playing with my son.

\- after turning off notifications, I had little use for Apple Watch. I use smart watch to track my activities, and not gonna lie - Apple Watch sucks for sport. Software is not there I think, so I switched to Garmin and never looked back. I don't use notifications on Garmin, I don't need to charge it every day, is collects great amount of data of my health, sport performance, recovery etc.",danrokk,3,0,2023-01-25 19:24:23,Apple Watch

"Bad first party software. I moved from a Garmin FR245 to a Apple Watch 6, then a few months later moved to a Fenix 6, now have an Epix.

The AW has better hardware, but the activity tracking and viewing experience is just so bad and basic. I used workoutdoors for a while, but it still wasn’t as good as Garmin. Also the lack of continuous hr monitoring was a deal breaker.

Also notification handling was worse than on the Garmin. Poor notification UI seems to be a theme with Apple.

Also no ANT+ support, and if I remember correctly no HR broadcasting.

I think the only thing I miss about the AW is having directions on my wrist when navigating somewhere. For a GPS navigation company, Garmin is surprisingly bad at that.",WholesomeCirclejerk,2,0,2023-01-25 15:14:59,Apple Watch
"I am not generally an early adopter but all the employees at my previous job were given an Apple Watch shortly after they were released.  After a few years of using it, the battery started to take a full day to charge and then just stopped charging at all.  Around that same time the latest iOS version stopped supporting the series 0 watch.  When I decided to replace it I looked at the current watch but decided that the Fitbit Charge does everything I need for half the price and has a much longer battery life.

What I hate the most about AW is that it makes me decide wether I should wear it instead of a classic watch. That’s the only thing I hate.

"I had a series 2, wore it for about 2.5 years until it stopped charging. I took it into Apple and they said the cost of repair would basically be the same price as buying a new 3. I ditched the watch and went back to the trusty Timex Expedition.

I didn’t feel like the Apple Watch was fulfilling any essential functionality for me, and I didn’t really miss it after switching back. I wasn’t doing much cardio back then so the majority of the apps weren’t much use to me — the only thing I missed was the sleep tracker.

Fast forward a few years and we’re mid-pandemic and I’m getting more into outdoor walks and cardio fitness, so I purchased an Apple Watch 7. I wear it every day and I like it, and I’d probably replace it if I lost/broke it, but I still feel like it’s not the most critical piece of technology for me.

As a final thought, I do have a growing feeling that being so connected is not great for my mental health. I turned off pretty much every single watch notification aside from messages and alarms because the incessant vibration on my wrist was extremely distracting and taking way too much of my focus away from “real life.” Wearables are cool, and I do find practicality from my Apple Watch, but sometimes I wish I weren’t so connected.",awaymsg,2,0,2023-01-26 03:36:04,Apple Watch

Basically what happened for me was that the longer I had my Apple Watch the more I felt like I was getting addicted to my phone and it’s notifications. Even if I was somewhere important I would get the notification and need to check it. I know that you can turn off the notifications but I didn’t want to do that because if I paid for it I was going to use it to its best capabilities.

Size, optics. Those things are clunky, heavy on the wrist and I find them aesthetically unappealing. Found myself never using any of the features the watch just ended up a massively oversized time-telling device.

"In short, with an iPhone at your side it’s kind of redundant, needs better features, battery, reliability, longevity, and less software bugs.

What it does have thats useful are the incredibly customizable complications (which sometimes don’t work), calendar, weather, stocks, messages at a glance, reminders for grocery lists, quick controls, timer, and health running data like distance and vertical oscillation. However, my phone does 95% of that on a much larger and easier to use display which kind of makes the Watch redundant. 

But the software problems are hilariously bad. The Apple Watch is still not ready. Swiping to clear notifications still registers as a tap 20% of the time. AirPods Pro 2 frequently won’t connect, disconnect, pause, I can’t skip songs or adjust the volume in workouts on the watch, it doesn’t show the current playing song and gets stuck on a blank screen, the watch wont load weather data that’s on my phone constantly, calendar event notifications still show up even though it’s set to mirror my iPhone with them off, there’s constantly something annoying me that I have to figure out how to get working, yet my radio-controlled GShock sits silently ticking away, exactly on time, sipping energy from the sun to keep itself running all by itself. 

A regular watch is dead simple and reliable. A smartwatch will also never last as long as a regular watch, let alone a solar powered one. Until the Apple Watch gets close to that or has some incredible health features, battery life or recharging capabilities from solar, body heat, or kinetic energy I’m not coming back.",Bravenkind,2,0,2023-03-20 10:36:33,Apple Watch

"I wore the series 4 for a year and a half but ultimately sent it in for trade in credit. It was bought primarily for the EKG and exercise tracking features, but I quickly started getting annoyed by the constant pokes to move or workout. Of course those could be turned off, but I bought to watch for exercise so without the notifications it would be mostly decorative. I went with the cellular model so I wouldn’t need to take my phone to the gym, but two months after purchase I moved abroad and the cellular wasn’t compatible so that purpose went out the window—and I didn’t really need the communication features (calls, texts) once the cellular kicked the bucket because I had to carry my phone around anyway. To top it off the battery would randomly give up despite being fully charged but Apple customer service kept running diagnostics and insisting nothing was wrong with it.

I love mechanical watches. If apple found a way to add more longevity to these devices then maybe I would go back but I don't think they can.

"When it was time to upgrade my Series 3, I bought the Garmin Fenix and lasted about 6 months before switching back to an Apple Watch. 

The iOS limitations that Apple imposes were just too much for me in the end. You’re basically unable to act on or respond to any notifications, so you always need to have your phone to do anything. 

I also found Apple’s activity ring far more motivating for me to stay active. I think Garmin’s idea of “beating yesterday” and setting goals based on the previous day’s activities is smart, but I found myself slipping a lot and actually being demotivated if missed a streak or had a bad day. This is all moot if you’re already a fitness buff of course. 

The one thing I really didn’t like about the Garmin is the OS/UI, but that’s subjective.

"I got my first Apple Watch a few months ago. I didn’t really use it for much so thought it was a waste. I’m now working out with a personal trainer and it’s nice to have all the health and activity info. The training app we use syncs with my watch so everything works together. I do sleep with it. I didn’t sleep well before I started working out. I do like having that info, but sometimes the watch it annoying af to sleep with. I don’t know if I’ll have the watch for years, but will definitely keep it for the next 7 months while I have my trainer. I limit the notifications I get, so it’s not super distracting.

"Smart watch enthusiast here, I have been using smart watches even before they where labelled as such (see [Sony Ericsson Live View](https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-01-sony-ericsson-liveview-review.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIHj18NqybG2aDTFqF2JgUj3Q56Zc02__OtTSycwHZ00CKT-bbE1IufQBXfEYwn-n4lCsxNPzZBlXHmSyyeNbd_maOBpev1sU-0Qo28ytiRJrLB98TxxKvUVLnE11bcmUR2Fc1LDglsjBwnewZ1UhqyzXRPU6GQBtrdnuvHsjxcS)) and although you seem to be looking for people who have since abandoned the idea and maybe then for reasons not to buy one, I feel like if you're really on the fence and have not used one before then perhaps continue reading.

Since the Live View, I have owned, in order... I think (also, might have missed some)...

* Sony SmartWatch
* Sony SmartWatch 2
* LG G Watch
* LG G Watch R
* LG G Watch Urbane
* Samsung Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier
* Mobvoi TikWatch Pro
* Samsung Galaxy Watch 3
* Fossil Gen 5
* Apple Watch Series 7

I made a switch last year to iPhone after many years of using Android as a daily driver (a conversation in itself) with the last iPhone I used as my main phone being a 4S.

I did very briefly use a first gen Apple Watch with a work iPhone (a 7 or 8 I think) at the time, but thought it, much like the iPhone at that time, was very limited.

Apple's products have come a long way recently, allowing me to try switching to them as a daily driver and so far, my time with them including the Watch, has been great.

Now I used to work directly in the mobile phone industry and now work in IT as a whole so I have always had access to the latest and greatest as a part of my job.

That said, even if I didn't, I would still use a smart watch as I personally find them an incredibly useful tool day to day. I like having quick access to notifications, especially in environments where I can't/don't want to use my phone such as in meetings, movie theatres or walking the scary streets of London late at night.

That latter part being even more necessary when needing directions to somewhere and not wanting to constantly be holding a £1500 brick in my hand.

Apply the same to things like skipping a song in a playlist or skipping back a few seconds on a podcast or audiobook. I also use it as my alarm clock. I find waking up to subtle wrist vibrations (insert joke here) far less jarring than loud noises.

They're also useful for payments with Google Pay/Apple Pay. Handy to quickly get though the London Underground or to quickly run to the store without needing my phone or wallet.

I do not use any of the health aspects of these devices, aside from once every so often looking at sleep patterns, so I cannot comment on them.

All in all though, they are a tool that I use daily and would recommend them if any of the above use cases suit you.

For the Apple Watch specifically, it's a really solid device. It's responsive and well made with a pretty decent UI (if you disable the stupid default app grid layout and switch to a list) with ok-ish battery life.

It will last two full days for me (without the Always-On display but WiFi, Bluetooth and Cellular on) and charges fairly quickly with the original charger. If it needs topping up, it will usually go from 10% to 90/100% in the time it takes for me to have breakfast, have a shower, get dressed and ready, so charging is of little inconvenience.

That said I do miss the 4-5 days I could get with the Samsung watches, they would easily last a weekend trip without the need for me to take a charger with me and even if I did need one, you can charge them with the reverse wireless charging feature of Samsung's phones (hello Apple??).

I also miss being able to install third party watch faces from the store, you're kinda stuck with what Apple gives you so they're not overly personalisable in that sense and in that same breath, I also think a round smart watch looks nicer.

I personally couldn't see myself ever ditching them and if any of this has appealed to you, get one but if you're not 100% sure it will be useful to you then don't.",adkeyz,1,0,2023-01-25 15:52:29,Apple Watch
"My first smart watch was the Apple Watch SE2 Cellular. Got it on release day and I love it. I use it daily to track my walks with my dog and its fun to get achievements for movements made throughout the day. Also, the biggest thing I appreciate is being able to keep my phone stored away completely while at work. I got the watch to use my iPhone 11 less...I want to squeeze out 2 more years from that phone. So the watch was a my substitute for a phone upgrade. I leave my phone at home when I go on walks or to the grocery store.  In conclusion, the watch allows me to stay connected (texts/calls/email) without being distracted. On the phone, it's super easy for me to slip into social media after a text...

If you don’t appreciate one or both purposes, then it’s mostly a time piece.

"Oh, this is me.

I decided after owning Apple Watches since the beginning, that I wanted to change for a variety of reasons.

\#1 - same black rectangle year after year. Doesn't matter which bands you put on it, doesn't matter which color case I had, even the Ultra didn't matter - it's the same black shiny rectangle. I really was craving a round watch, but this wasn't initially enough to sway me.

\#2 - catching myself looking at notifications during meetings and important situations where it probably came across as me not caring or something of that nature. I felt like I was addicted to it, and it was keeping me from taking time away from my electronics, notifications and work/life in general. I get that they can be turned off or silenced, but at that point, it's just a shiny, black rectangular watch - yes it has fitness tracking, but I'll address that in a few.

\#3 - I kept seeing watches that I really liked. Commemorative watches, different Citizen Eco-Drive watches that I wanted to buy, but I kept guilting myself into the sunken cost fallacy - I paid $X for this smartwatch and I'm going to use it - but then I realized that a real wristwatch doesn't go obsolete with the next release, usually has a 5+ year warranty, can be serviced, and will last me a lifetime if I take care of it. Also, it doesn't need to be charged every night

\#4 - the lack of a rest day or sick day option. I was guilting myself for needing a break and addicted to the rings, streaks, and awards. I felt guilty for taking a 3-5 mile walk or hike that only registered 15 minutes of movement because the elevation change wasn't high enough or the pace wasn't fast enough, etc..

&#x200B;

It's been really, really hard to let go.

"I'm in the ecosystem and had an Apple Watch circa 2017-2018.

I didn't like the Apple Watch because:

* I didn't really use it beyond 'playing' with it. 
* I disliked having to charge it every 1-2 days.
* It's huge compared to the watch I was used to (bracelet style Casio Lineage). 
* I also hated having to wear it tight on my wrist to get the tracking features. 

Mainly I just needed the watch to tell the time and set alarms and timers. I found the health tracking stuff gimmicky and uninteresting after a couple weeks. I suppose if I was an athlete training it would be more useful. 

I also became a little skeptical once I learned that depending on how tight and exactly where on my wrist I wore the watch the metrics would vary.

"Switched to a Garmin full-time instead of just when I was running. It fit my needs better and I was tired of managing two watches.

After I made the switch, I realized how much better my life was not getting notifications on my watch. I also like the longer battery life on the Garmin, which was a tradeoff of not having as many ""smart"" features or the same kind of screen.

It was also draining my iPhone battery so eventually I decided to sell the Apple Watch and go without it for a while.  Then, I realized I then checked my phone way too often so the problem was just social media, go figure.

I wear my watch everyday and I've gotten better at detaching myself from my notifications, improving my QoL.

"I have a Series 3 so take my opinion with a grain of salt:

I used to wear it on the daily, it was super useful for keeping track of meetings; having the calendar on my wrist was awesome. Getting notifications on my wrist while i'm away from my phone is also really nice, but can get annoying sometimes.

&#x200B;

I originally wanted to use it for fitness tracking but I don't think it packs enough features compared to my Garmin Instinct. The Garmin instinct is just a better smart tool; the GPS is better, it tracks snowboard runs, has better structured workouts (although apple is actively working on this).

Battery life sucks compared to my garmin instinct. Disclaimer the Series 3 is a 5 year old watch but I think most apple watches can last up to 2 days if youre careful. My garmin can last two weeks between charges. However my Garmin doesn't have nearly as many smart phone integrations as the apple watch. 

Also I just like wearing mechanical watches a bit more than smart watches. Thats just my personal preference. 

&#x200B;

I think the Apple Watch is a great gadget though. If you want another toy or another apple extension, go for it. If you're looking for a good outdoor tool, get a Garmin or Polar.

I would love to use it for sleep tracking, but then it needs to be charged. But a charge will last through a day and not through a day + a night. It's stupid. I don't know why it has a touch screen, two pressible buttons and a wheel. I find these buttons totally unintuitive for navigating the watch, and I've had it for over 5 years.

Besides that I work in IT so I have my phone and computer in front of me for at least 9 hours most days which are just better for interacting with notifications.

But clicking through a postage sized stamp to start and end a workout, manually going into apps, that is not the interaction pattern I want in my life.

"I have one and it was all about the cool factor. I talked to that watch like I was Dick Tracy(google it, yes I am that old). It was fun. But it really didn’t do what I needed it to do. I need to track my sleep and activity level. Since you have to charge the watch EVERY day, no sleep tracking. And it does not charge fast so if you do it during the day, you have lost 1/2 of your activity every day. The charger is a one off. It charges nothing else so when you travel you have to carry it. Next I found that putting even one APP on it was enough to blow all the memory and you had to reinvent the wheel every time you needed to do a software update. And it is Apple so that means the updates happen frequently.

So I went back to Fitbit. Only has to be charged once a week. It also has an oddball charger but once a week makes it functional even if you are not home every day. I can’t talk to it but it does what I need it to do for a week without being tethered to a charger. No cool factor but it meets my needs. The Fitbit is easy and effortless.

If the battery on the  Apple Watch lasted a week, I would still be wearing mine and replacing it as necessary. I would have been willing to buy bigger and better with more memory.",MarsupialMaven,1,0,2023-01-25 22:02:39,Apple Watch

The Apple Watch has made me a more productive person.

* I have a calendar alert in the morning which reminds me to add alarms for each thing I have to do that day. Could I do it with my phone? Sure... but the watch is silent and I can snooze it
* If there's something that just happened and I need to remind myself in just a bit to record it or write it down... I set a short 5/15 minute timer. Something long enough that I know I'll be alone to record what just happened
* I use the timer for cooking
* My medications minder is on my wrist
* It tracks my sleep. Sleeping has also been a genetic issue in my family and for other reasons... should be tracked. I've been thankful that I could track my sleeping before and after CPAP
* It actually keeps me active.

If they’d moved in the direction of letting you use the watch entirely without a phone, I likely wouldn’t have switched; would’ve instead ditched my phone and had only a Watch and an iPad.

I definitely don’t use my watch for regular day to day use anymore. Even if I wanted to use it for work; it wouldn’t sync well with my calendars and if it did - I have SO many meetings & things that I wouldn’t even want it syncing with it + my personal stuff.

In short, it’s a pile of nice to have, weighed against one more thing to charge. One thing that catches occasionally and thus risks it getting damaged or me getting hurt. A thing for my offspring to try and steal, try to break, and catch just to have something to pull at.

"I got more into fitness and outdoors. I got excited about the Apple Watch Ultra and then realised all the people in the adverts would be wearing Garmin Fenix watches.

I've switched from Series 6 to Fenix 6 Pro Sapphire. Stronger screen, battery life lasts more than 2 weeks, works better for fitness and with external devices such as Ant+ and HR monitors.

I was a big Apple fan but ended up realising that anything does on the Apple Watch is pointless, or can be done better on another device. My Garmin can still receive notifications. If you had Android you can respond on the watch but Apple choose to restrict this. The only thing the watch can do which other's can't is Siri for quick responses but that is hit or miss. 

Unlocking my MacBook was cool but it takes 1 second to enter my password vs almost instantly on Apple Watch but also at times having to wait 5 seconds for the watch to talk to the Mac and have to put my password in anyway.",techtom10,1,0,2023-01-29 11:18:30,Apple Watch

"actually it fits well and i'd prefer it over other brands if you already own apple products. for the notification you can customize them however you want or get rid of them completely. for me my phone is always silent and i check notification on my watch, i find it less distracting to check a notification on watch rather than checking the phone. It is also very useful for alarms and reminders. I also like the health tracking that it does in the background so you can keep track of your health and fitness level if interested, if not you can always ignore then but your data is always there for you. of course it differs from person to person on how to use but for me after having one for a long time, i feel lost without it.",hjay_z,1,0,2023-02-02 12:58:14,Apple Watch
"Honestly, this is difficult to answer. Until now, i never really stopped to think about WHY i put my watch away and never picked it back up….

First off, id say COVID contributed to a lot of it. Not only was i going nowhere and had no real reason to wear it, but i was out of work (i worked at a cell phone sales company, coincidentally) because of the extremely high risks my health issues impose when combined with COVID. Because of this, my phone got shut off (working for a cell company has its perls, am i right? SMH) so it basically wasn’t usable anymore, considering my brand new iPhone 11 was a Wi-Fi-only brick. 

Fast forward to 2022, I’m back to work, getting back on my feet, and I’m waiting tables again, (which i swore id never do again, but needed something to get back on my feet again) and once i got my phone back on i realized i really didn’t want to wear my watch to work, bang it on every shelf, table, corner etc. during busy times and when cleaning stuff, etc. And although watches are extremely helpful in restaurant work, I realzed the extensive amount of features of the Apple Watch would basically only make wearing one at my job more of a chore and likely a distraction more than helpful.

I decided to pull my old G-Shock 5600 out of my drawer, where its been since 2010 or so, and replace the battery to wear to work. This, along with the owner and manager of my place of employment being really into traditional analog watches, got me super into collecting G-Shocks and vintage Casios again, along with exploring some vintage and/or automatic watches by companies like Seiko. 

I’ve always been a guy that likes to accessorize well (I went crazy on Apple Watch bands) and I feel like wearing a new watch everyday to work based on how I’m feeling that morning kinda gives me a feeling that the Apple Watch can’t. Your watch collection is full of personality, every piece is different, they all do something else (both in terms of what they do for you and in terms of literal functionality). I love the Apple Watch as I’m a technology and electronics nerd more so than anything, but I’m also kinda the type that values things you can’t measure specifically. It now feels like everyone has an Apple Watch and they’re all the same, whereas a watch collection kinda says more about who you are, and when you pair that with being used as a fashion accessory *in addition to* using its ACTUAL functionality (alarms, timers, etc.) its no contest. 

I still remember the day i got my Apple Watch, how absolutely blown away i was. I have a series 3 that I got right when the 5 came out. Before that, i had never used one before. I distinctly remember thinking “I can’t believe i lived so much of my life without this thing” as the turn-by-turn directions, music streaming to and from, the instant weather updates, etc. were all handy, but considering the work i did at the time, the ability to see your notifications without having to pause your conversation with a potential buyer, that was HUGE. I could instantly see if it was my boss, another client, or just a friend / family saying hello, without rudely pulling my phone out of my pocket. My productivity honestly doubled considering how much of my job was spent on a mobile device. I also had 2 phones at the time, but in a way the watch made it 3, giving me 3x the amount of productivity and drastically increasing my sales numbers du dot efficiency.

But in the end, i think its honestly a case of over-complication. As cool as they are, its a bit *too much*. I get enough notifications and distractions that I (and my boss) hate dealing with. Not to mention the god damn battery charging. No less than once per day. I already charge 2 phones, an iPad, AirPods, an old click wheel iPod (but its been modded so it doesn’t need it often lol) and whatever else I’m forgetting too. The question is, WHEN am i supposed to charge it!? I’m supposed to use it as a sleep tracker, so not while i sleep (which is only 2-4 hours anyway and likely wont fill it) I can’t do it at work because i actually need to wear it. On my commute? It’s always a pain as sharp turns and movement make it slide off the magnetic charger. Not to mention, i only have so many plugs/cables and i have other things for my job that need charged.

Chalk it up to simplicity i guess. *shrug*",j_del_fresco,1,0,2023-03-23 08:31:57,Apple Watch

I had a Huawei smart watch before AW SE2, fortunately it had a AOD, but the thing that annoys me the most is not the AOD, but it’s attitude of going black instantly as you put it off your face, my Huawei watch would not go into AOD mode instantly after I put my wrist down.

"Most people buying an Ultra don’t need an Ultra. Apple knew this going in, so do reviewers. I saw an older woman wearing one at dinner the other night. I have my reasons, but she clearly wasn’t an extreme athlete. You also have people like me who definitely aren’t extreme athletes but wanted a larger Apple Watch, something bigger than 45mm. Even now, I still want a larger watch face than the 49mm of the Ultra. Give me a 55mm watch face and I’ll be happy.

I don’t use my Ultra for anything it’s advertised for, I normally didn’t use my previous Apple Watches for anything advanced either. Answering a few texts, seeing who is calling, controlling music playback, and tracking my daily activity along with exercises. Almost something that could be handled with a Fitbit (Apple and iMessage lockout). But, I always prefer the stainless Apple Watches and the Ultra was only $50 more for a larger unit.

I knew what I was getting into, that is heavier and larger than the 45mm S7/8 SS. I knew what to expect and how it would fit since I’ve worn 50-60mm watches before.",P_Devil,222,0,2022-11-30 19:18:33,Apple Watch

I moved from an AW7 to a Garmin solely because of the battery. I moved to the AWU from the Garmin because it gave me the features I appreciate along with the improvement in battery. I didn’t fully utilize the capabilities of the Garmin but get much more usability out of the AWU. Size isn’t an issue for me because most of my watches have been on the bulky size even when soley analog. I like the look of the standard AW8 better. I do fit into a few of the AWU demographics but I’d never use it as a dive computer as a dive computer is a vital piece of equipment that takes a lot of abuse. More than an AWU could take I’m afraid.,curiousonethai,6,0,2022-11-30 21:11:36,Apple Watch

I go to the gym a lot and hike a lot. I get that its not 'extreme' but I tend to bang my watch on tread mill or find other ways to bang it. Wit it being titanium and sapphire, I no longer worry about banging my watch anyway.

Of course, I like the extended battery life. Kinda wish it can go longer. Last time I charged to 100% was on Monday and with light use and use it for sleep tracking. It is now Wednesday at 62%.",Kooramah,5,0,2022-11-30 18:07:29,Apple Watch

"I've had my ultra for about a month now too, and honestly I am loving the upgrade from my S6. Mainly because of the battery life honestly. I hated having to charge the watch every night, or during the morning while I am making my coffee, and having it last till about the end of the day.   


The design is also another factor in why I decided to go with the ultra honestly. I love the look of the titanium body and the flat screen has a certain appeal to me over the curved screen every watch has had.  


I use it primarily to track my workouts throughout the day and its been doing that absolutely wonderfully. Whether I am riding my bike, running, or hiking, the battery doesn't take as much of a hit as it used to. I don't think I have ever seen my battery drop more than 10%, I also don't think I have ever seen it below 30-40%, but thats because I charge it while in the shower.  


Apple markets it towards ""extreme"" athletes, but I don't really think that's who the watch is really made for. I think its more designed for athletes who want a computer for their sport, but also dont want to have to take a watch off and put a different one on, or set something else up to track their workout. I've used it on a hike, and its useful, but it doesnt do anything super special.",EvilNickel,2,0,2022-12-01 05:49:30,Apple Watch

"I upgraded from an S6 to Ultra and have been loving it, but I definitely get it's not for everyone. It's much larger and I have skinny wrists but I'm willing to put up with it for the sapphire display, extra battery, and better GPS (I used to wear old school Garmins so the Ultra is still smaller than those). 

I do a lot of trail runs and my S6 was all over the place with GPS. With one route in particular (a 3.1 mile out and back), my turnaround point was always different, sometimes an extra .25 miles from the previous run. Since upgrading to the Ultra the turnaround point is usually within .05 of each run. Even on city runs, my brother with a Garmin (with GPS and GLONASS enabled) would always be ahead of me mileage-wise to the tune of 0.1+ miles. With the Ultra we're now within 0.02 miles of each other.

AW doesn’t have offline maps for running, etc. You can use an app called WorkOutDoors for offline map running.

AW will not broadcast your heart rate. You can use ECHO iWatch Heart Rate to broadcast you watch HR to other fitness machines.

All of he above are things that Garmin watches will do better OOTB. I found the above to be ok workarounds before I switched to Garmin. The AW is not suitable for serious fitness and outdoor activities. Apple is failing at pulling together all of your health AND fitness metrics (some are completely missing) into one comprehensive dashboard/location. I will not go into battery life comparisons because you can’t work around the hardware limitations.

If you intend to use the watch for basic fitness, motivation, entertainment, as a status symbol, then it’s likely fine as is.

On a positive note. AW has the most accurate wrist sleep monitoring and heart rate measurements of all brands. Just make sure to keep the Watch tight on your wrist when exercising.

One last thing. Buy AppleCare+ with Accident protection. This way if you get an annoying scratch or something, you can just smash the Watch and get a new one. I’ve never scratched a watch, but I have my phone. Let’s just say that shortly afterwards I accidentally dropped a dumbbell on it. A very “unfortunate” sequence of events. Apple always replaces with very little fuss. I’ve even had a person at the Apple Store recommend this approach.",CambrianAged,0,0,2022-12-26 13:36:23,Apple Watch

The slight conveniences and athelte specific feature are not enough to justify another device. You would never google search or watch youtube on it,

"I own a pair of Rolexes, three Omegas, a Breitling, multiple Tags, multiple Tissots, etc. I held off on buying an Apple Watch for years because I thought the materials were shit and they just didn’t do enough. They released the Apple Watch ultra last year and my wife and I both bit. 

I now rarely take the Apple Watch off for a fancy one. It just is so fucking useful to have a remote/phone/weather readout/timer/etc on my wrist. I also have to be less careful with it than I do with a lot of my Swiss stuff. The lab sapphire on it is harder than the faces on the older watches and the apple urethane band is on par with the ones I have on other quality stuff (Swatches, one of the tags). It’s also much much lighter than the chronographs and doesn’t inflame my wrist if I wear it too long in a day. 

I figure I have 5-7 years with the Apple Watch and then I will happily recycle it or do whatever with it as a watch shaped device. It was less than my phone and I suspect I’ll get longer out of it. I just consider it a different type of good. 

The “nice” watches are like a savings account I get to wear and enjoy. They appreciate almost exactly at the rate of inflation. I have a jeweler that specializes just in watches and he makes it painless to walk in with one I’m tired of and I can convert it to cash or I can pay him a little differential and pick something else from his case. I actually might celebrate some work success by trading my ~$4500 Brietling into a ~$15000 Brietling chrono that I really like. One of my friends got one and I think it looks much better in person than the advertising.

I suspect people with the gold Apple Watches likely have a similar outlook…

"People are complaining about the price here. This is not a watch to wear to the office. This is for outdoor activities.

As a professional scuba diver I think this is really huge and a big innovation! The dive computer market is a niche. Usually these computers were of no use outside the water. Garmin entered that market like 2 years ago and started to combine smart watches and dive computers. Now Apple enters that market. Up to now, dive computer were mostly really ugly. Now we divers get a neat Apple Watch. Dive computers can also be quite expensive and you needed to buy at least two gadgets, now you have all-in-one. So as a scuba diver, the price is fair.

Ultra is definitely aiming at Garmin crowd but they’re well aware they’re way behind to take everyone. If you’re doing multi day hunting or hiking, use your Garmin. Other reason Garmin lasts so damn long is it isn’t powering a touch screen with ton of sensors. Trade offs.

"The statements and interviews from Ive and Co around the original watch are fascinating. They understood that there were other smart watches on the market, but that each was designed exclusively as a tool. You chose to wear a Garmin because you were a runner. You chose to wear a Fitbit because you were measuring steps. 

Releasing the Hermes and Gold edition were about demonstrating that a smart watch could function as a fashion item AND a tool. 

I really don’t think they intended for it to replace a Rolex, they intended for you to choose to wear it in place of a Rolex.  

Ultimately, it worked. People wear Apple Watches and never use any of its apps or functions. I see them paired with suits or dresses, and no one thinks it’s tacky.",Lou3000,2,0,2023-10-02 20:39:11,Apple Watch

"I bought my Apple Watch 4 for one very pedestrian reason: My work forbade anyone to text while in the shop. I had customers who would text when they had a problem and I couldn't text back even if the problem was easily fixable and it was something they could do. But I could just glance at my watch and know who called and why and call them back with an answer instead of having them explain what the problem was again. Getting caught texting was a 3 day suspension, and my work actually did that for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

Later I discovered another use: I could control my phones camera remotely. We build assembly machines that have a lot of protective guards and many times you couldn't see what or when the problem occurred. But I could mount the phone inside the guards and turn on the video while it was running and I could find and fix a lot of problems much more quickly.

I take my dogs for walks and I use the health app to monitor how far. I don't really need to but it sometimes prompts me to go a little farther if I am close to a milestone distance. For what I bought the watch for it has worked fairly well.",Juviltoidfu,2,0,2023-10-03 21:41:43,Apple Watch

"I’m just seeing so many comments from people who don’t actually know how a CGM (continues glucose monitor) works saying that this will or can replace them. 

It can’t. CGMs work well because they have a component that gets inserted INTO someone’s body. It’s like a flexible wire that is about a quarter inch long, gets inserted at a diagonal, and sits underneath your skin into the fat layer. A watch is not going replicate that, and because of that, is not going to be accurate. Sure maybe it can give estimates or general amounts, but for someone with diabetes, especially T1, that is not going to work well enough to give accurate levels.

And if you disagree, seriously do a minimal amount of research, and it should be quickly evident why, esp for T1s, detailed and very accurate information is needed, and the type of blood glucose readings t1s need will NOT be covered by a watch.

"I see it as different watch for different purposes. Sure an apple watch is much much more accurate, does a lot more than your mechanical watch. Makes life easy. But the apple watch lasts only as long as apple supports it. It gets outdated, it cannot be passed on as an heirloom and like all electronic devices it will fail catastrophically one day and you’ll need a new watch. 

A mechanical watch isn’t about features. It’s about craftsmanship. It’s something that has your life story, its been through ups and downs in your life. Perhaps you wore that mechanical watch during the toughest phase of your life, perhaps you proposed to your wife while wearing it. Perhaps you went paragliding with your son while wearing the watch. Perhaps your son will carry forth your legacy once you die with that watch. It serves one purpose and that is to tell the time and keep you productive, a smartwatch defeats the purpose of staying productive which is what a watch was designed for.

I did consider getting a withins watch (hybrid) instead of the AW, for its analogue style, while keeping some important elements (health monitoring, notifications). Hybrid watches are also better in battery life. However, these do lack functions such as maps or the weather, that made me go for the AW instead.

"I'm quite the opposite actually. After purchasing my first mechanical watch, I've neglected my AW S6. I had it for around a year, and could not imagine life without it. It easily became my favourite Apple product. Once I bought my mechanical watch, I swapped my AW to my other hand, and had it reversed (facing down). After playing around with one watch on each wrist for around a month, I decided that I hated it. Besides the strange looks and questions I got, it got really uncomfortable when typing as I couldn't properly rest my wrist on surfaces. Having it faced down also made me quite warm, but I'm not sure if there's any correlation between the two.

I adore my mechanical watch now, and I sadly don't see myself going back to an AW. Whilst I had the Apple Watch, I loved the fact that I was always connected to my phone at all times, and could read texts and notifications from there. Now that I don't wear it, I love being detached from it. When I put my phone down, it's truly away from me and I'm not going to be bothered.

"Thanks to your post, I'm now trying out wearing my AW8 on my left wrist and my stainless steel Rolex Air King on my right wrist.  It feels weird, but I'm just not used to it (yet).  The Rolex is quite heavy compared to the AW!  (And yet it's probably one of the lighter ones, I guess.)  Since you ask, here's the story behind the Rolex: in 1980 I was still wearing the Timex that my dad had bought me (paid for) when I went off to college.  It had cost about $50, and he was shocked and not very happy about that.  It kept good time but made a rather loud clanking (not ticking) noise.  Well, in 1980 I went to India to work for the US Government there, and I discovered duty-free catalogs and started obsessing over watches.  I decided that I needed a better watch, something more congruent with my newly elevated (I thought) status in life.....  So I sold my Timex, as well as a terrific post-war Yashica copy of a Leica rangefinder (how I wish I hadn't sold that) and bought my Rolex Air King directly from Rolex Geneva through the diplomatic pouch, tax- and duty-free, for about US$400.  I wore it every day for the next 27 years, until I dropped it and, in spite of being Oyster-Perpetual, it stopped.  It took me several years to decide to spend the $800 (!!!!! yes, $800) on the requisite authorized Rolex repair/tune-up, but I eventually did, and then wore it another 15 years until my last birthday, when I decided I needed (wanted) an AW for its health and fitness and hiking/GPS functions. I like and use the AW's aforementioned features, but I also treasure my Rolex, so now I've got to decide whether to let each watch take turns on my left wrist, or to wear them both, even if that does look kind of dumb.  The AW is all black and the Rolex is shiny stainless steel, so maybe they don't ""compete"" with each other very much. I'm aware that this is a genuine 1st-world problem, but ... there you go.",FrameOne9692,1,0,2023-10-10 15:11:46,Apple Watch

That was a $1,000 watch, which was definitely a splurge, but I wore it for 3 years before I gave it to a friend who still uses it, and the nicer crystal means it still looks pretty pristine (vs. the acrylic or whatever on the base models, which tends to accumulate scratches).

So - you set a goal (e.g. 'I want to lose 10kg by June') .. your Watch monitors what goes in (calories) and what goes out (exercise / movement) .. and bugs you during the day to meet your goals .. and reconsider that cheesecake !

"ITT: Apple fanbois dismissing Garmin watches as *fitness trackers*.

AW and Garmin watches are fundamentally different products. 

You can wear a Garmin on you 9-5 routine  and it will be somehow useful. However, AW will crush any Garmin on that environment.

Get out of the city/gym and Garmin absolutely destroys AW on every comparison, not only battery. A Fénix/Epix 2 is the only watch I need to wear for plane piloting/scuba/sailing/parachute jumping/x-trail motorbike driving/ironman/ultramarathon/rally/skiing/etc. It's compatible with most fitness/marine/positioning equipment and works fine under any circumstances; bright day, starry night, pouring rain, freezing blizzard, scorching desert heat... Under water, under sand, under snow... 

I charge it for 10min whenever I take a shower and that's all I need, it never goes below 90% with all the bells and whistles activated and heavy app use. And if I'm far from a charger, I still have two weeks of juice left.

So, Garmin may have exaggerated with the ""months"" claim, but don't delude yourselves, the AW is a fine smartwatch and gym fitness/health tracker, but any Garmin runs circles around it for everything else.",Diplomatic_Barbarian,63,0,2022-09-09 19:35:51,Apple Watch

"I just went with the Enduro 2 after having a couple versions of the Apple Watch up to the Series 7.   The Apple watch is a very nice device, but I'm very happy I made the switch over the the Garmin.  It fits what I do and want better (which is very long days in the mountains, or multiple days) and I don't miss all the other crap that was on my Apple Watch.   Agree with those that say they are just two really different products.  I prefer one that is specialized to what I need/want it for, and has a longer battery life. It is so nice not to to have to put my damn watch on the charger every day or have it be dead. I'm sure the Ultra will be nice in that regard, but not as nice as the Enduro 2.

The other thing that was happening to me with the Apple Watch was (and I have not idea how since I had disabled all the autologon stuff and had a pin set on it) was being on an all day adventure only to have my sweat on my sleeve cause my tracking app to end the tracking prematurely. I was using the WorkOutdoors app.    I have \*never\* had this problem occur since switching to the Enduro 2.  Maybe other apps didn't have that issue, but I really liked that app on the Apple Watch, other than that deal killer issue.  With the Enduro 2, you can disable the touch screen and just use the buttons if you want. 

I just want something that accurately tracks my activity for as long as possible without charging, and I don't want any other distractions or things that burn battery unnecessarily.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that if you’re going to try to use the Clockology app as your watch face, be sure to go into your settings and change the “return to clock” setting to “after 1 hour” so it stays up :)",vitruuu,914,0,2023-01-16 14:57:15,Apple Watch

Dive log and Ultra modular watchface can't honestly require the Ultra 2 can they? That would be so damn stupid.,Pepparkakan,32,0,2023-09-12 17:36:25,Apple Watch
"Look, this upgrade is not targeted at U1 owners, or even owners of Apple Watches that are less than ~5 years old. We’ve seen updates across all their products get more and more incremental (except for major revisions) for years and years now. All y’all complaining that you don’t feel justified in upgrading from your U1, you are not the target demographic here. 

That being said, as someone who had a S-0 that crapped out in 2021 and has been wearing traditional watches since, I am disappointed by this upgrade, but not because of the spec increases (which, granted, are lackluster but see my point above about incremental upgrades), but that they didn’t have even a single new “killer feature” that’s exclusive to the U2 - double tap is available on the full line of (new) watches. 

I was pretty confident that I’d want to finally get a new AW after 2+ years without one but, now I’m not so sure.

ETA: in some ways, I actually am sort of happy about the incremental progression of upgrades. Means that a device will not automatically feel obsolete with the following year’s release.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36249475/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36249475/)

Some key points:

While there were 24 healthy participants, they didn't just say, ""all 24 are showing 98-99%"", instead they introduced them to low-oxygen and took 600 data points for comparison.

While you can buy fingertip sensors for $20, the actual fingertip sensor in the study is widely used at hospitals and sells for $287.

This was with the Apple Watch 6.  

This may seem like an ""ad for a giant corporation"" but personally I find it rather surprising.  While I knew the SPO2 sensor on the Apple Watch was *useful,* I didn't think *anything* could compete on the wrist with a device on the fingertip at least in some situations (further testing is needed).

">  Methods: **We recruited 24 healthy participants.** Each participant wore a smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 6) on the left wrist and a pulse oximeter sensor (Masimo Radical-7) on the left middle finger. The participants breathed via a breathing circuit with a three-way non-rebreathing valve in three phases. First, in the 2-minute initial stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air. Then in the 5-minute desaturation phase, the participants breathed the oxygen-reduced gas mixture (12% O2), which temporarily reduced their blood oxygen saturation. In the final stabilization phase, the participants inhaled the ambient air again until SpO2 returned to normal values. Measurements of SpO2 were taken from the smartwatch and the pulse oximeter simultaneously in 30-s intervals.

> Results: There were **642 individual pairs of SpO2 measurements**. The bias in SpO2 between the smartwatch and the oximeter was 0.0% for all the data points. **The bias for SpO2 less than 90% was 1.2%.** The differences in individual measurements between the smartwatch and oximeter within 6% SpO2 can be expected for SpO2 readings 90%-100% and up to 8% for SpO2 readings less than 90%.

> Conclusions: **Apple Watch Series 6 can reliably detect states of reduced blood oxygen saturation with SpO2 below 90% when compared to a medical-grade pulse oximeter.** The technology used in this smartwatch is sufficiently advanced for the indicative measurement of SpO2 outside the clinic. 

This is a great lesson on why we shouldn't read ""study finds"" as ""this sounds factual"". Be very cautious whenever you see ""study finds..."" headlines. Go to the actual reported study itself. People would be shocked at how bullshit some of these ""studies"" are.

You can hardly come to any medical census with only 624 points of data for almost any study. Never mind the fact there were only 2 dozen participants. It's almost comical they think they've come to a conclusion.

"I'm kind of curious about how well the Apple Watch handles darker skin tones.  Those have been, and continue to be, a problem for ""traditional"" transdermal pulse oximeters.  [1] (https://www.apsf.org/article/apsf-statement-on-pulse-oximetry-and-skin-tone/) [2](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/skin-tone-pulse-oximetry) [3](https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article/102/4/715/7364/Effects-of-Skin-Pigmentation-on-Pulse-Oximeter) [4](https://www.statnews.com/2022/07/05/pulse-oximeters-accuracy-skin-color/) [5](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/10/pulse-oximeters-racial-disparities/)",neilmoore,2045,0,2022-10-26 01:02:00,Apple Watch
"Biomed engineer here and boy do I got several problems with this, specifically the articles intent to mislead (or at best they are horribly misinformed). Read the sourced paper and it uses similar terminology as well, leading me to believe the authors background on the subject is remedial at best or they are intentionally misleading readers on the efficacy of the study. It is also worth noting the study was marked with a clinical trial registration, so go ahead and add some bias to the study.

The gold standard for pulse oximetry is arterial blood gas analysis which requires a blood sample, so in most medical studies evaluating sensors the gold standard is the benchmark you evaluate against [1]. It is fast enough people still do it in hospitals when monitoring patients as needed. Comparing the apple watch to external pulse oximeters is not impressive, the FDA says time and time again to not use external over the counter pulse oximeters to ""assess your health or oxygen levels"", which defeats the purpose of buying these rip offs and consumer level health tracking in general [2]. Lastly, ""medical grade"" pulse oximeters go through very little analysis by the FDA compared to other devices as they are extremely low risk, so it is as medical grade as a bandaid (ie not as impressive as they are making it sound) [3]. The study referenced by the article also notes the common innaccuracy of +\- 8%  for over the counter pulse oximeters without a citation for that metric, so 1 demerit for the lone author for not giving me more ammo to call baloney. It is worth clarifying, there is no such thing as ""medical grade"" as a quality or safety standard for direct to consumer medical products. There's FDA cleared (less stringent, low risk like a new bandaid or over the counter products) and FDA approved (more stringent) [4]. So when something lists itself as medical grade on amazon, it doesn't mean anything on the quality of the device, at most just the intent for use (which can be untruthful on the safety of the device and has been my experience for unsafe ""medical grade"" lasers being sold on the platform). 

So, with all that info, apple watch is as good as pulse oximeters that the FDA issued warnings for people not to rely on them for blood oxygen info. The equivalent to this is this apple sand castle is as good at resisting waves as a medical grade sand castle sold by Amazon.

 And to bash the paper author a bit, they claim reliability of the measurements not through ground truth of the patients oxygen levels using gold standard techniques but using a well known innaccurate measuring method. In reality, as this is for a clinical trial, they should claim equivalence to the sub par performance of pulse oximeters instead of concluding the apple watch produces ""reliable"" metrics. So shame on them for marketing the efficacy of a product in a TRIAL  without validation against a reliable source of metrics.

The watch was obviously a way to try and target the Garmin, Coros, Suunto market. BUTTTT they didn’t bring a SINGLE functionality those offer. No altimeter, wayfinding, data points like gpx tracks.


I can find my way off a mountain in a complete white out because of a breadcrumbs map feature on my Suunto. Next watch is the Coros because it ability to nav while on route is even better. I honestly don’t know why people are so hype on the Garmin Fenix, it’s sort of bottom of the barrel in functionality.


But that brings us to the GPS emergency beacon Apple claims might be on par with Garmin. Which I doubt, I’ll keep my inreach subscription active. However I’m also just in on the 14 pro models. Why not have a possible back up? Not everyone has an inreach when we go out. Would hate for that person with the inreach to be buried in an avalanche while we have no way to call for help while digging them out…. So it’s a win if it proves as reliable or even close.

So emergency cord pull and I was whipped from a general induction to emergency situation as they kept confirming my watch and what was being picked up was mine. Anyway, it helped them identify that and we got labour underway and eventually an emergency section to get my little out distress.

Eerily similar situation to a family member. Except no Apple Watch in that case. Went to the doctor from fatigue but went to the wrong building. By the time they found the correct one it was past the appointment time and they wouldn’t see them anymore. Offered an appointment for 3 weeks later. Thankfully was able to get a doctor to see them on short notice at a nearby clinic. Got blood drawn and sent home. A few hours later they called saying to head to the ER immediately. Had a 3.6 level of hemoglobin. As we were told anything below 6 is automatic transfusion and life threatening. A few weeks later they got a letter from the original doctor saying they might be charged a fee for missing their appointment.

"I have a Garmin watch, I like to keep an eye on my heart rate- it calms some of my anxiety to see normal levels, or clues me in to when I need to relax. I picked a recentish model back when I got it so the tech was accurate at picking up bio info. It tracks sleep, energy levels, menses cycle, steps, and altitude (floors climbed). It can also be used to track hydration, but I don't bother with that. 

The connected app has fun challenges like expeditions, where you get badges for Everest or the Great Wall, by hitting a certain amount of steps/floors climbed.

"I primarily use mine to find my phone lol!

But a couple of other benefits:

I can control my music from my watch so I don’t have to find my phone to change a song or the volume.

Setting timers is as easy as saying Siri 4 minutes

It tracks my sleep so I can see changes over time.

My grocery list is on my watch so I don’t have to carry my phone around the store

The weather, date, time etc is right on my watch

We have a ring camera which I can set to ring only on my watch so visitors don’t wake up sleeping children

I’m really active so I like to see how my heart rate, walking/running speed, general health changes over time. Back in June I started an intense workout routine 5-6 days a week and it’s really encouraging to see how my fitness has improved in just 4 months. But it’s also good for just getting you off your ass. You can set it to remind you to stand every 50-60 minutes, and it can encourage you to be more active in general so that you increase your active calories burned.

If you’re just wanting a step-tracker, I don’t recommend Apple Watch. It’s not great a tracking steps for women, especially if you’re pushing a stroller or a shopping cart. I work with kids, and I actually have to tell my watch I’m working out (walking) for it to track my steps while I’m pushing a 5 seater stroller. Otherwise it thinks I’m standing or driving.

"Here is a list of what I use it for every day

* checking time/date: also useful if you forget the day of the week
* Previewing texts/emails: I can decide if I want to bother picking up my phone to respond. Before my watch, I would always get distracted on my phone just checking to see if I needed to respond to the email/text.
* finding my phone: I leave it in weird places like my closet and this cuts out like 5 minutes of me searching for my phone daily
* checking the temperature outside: so I can dress appropriately/bring an umbrella
* tracking workouts/steps: If I am walking somewhere, it will ask if I am working out and if I want to track it. But it starts the workout to when I started walking (like 10 minutes before the alert) so even if I forget to track, I don't lose the workout minutes
* tracking sleep: you can put it in sleep mode so the display stays off and it doesn't pop up notifications. It tracks the stages of sleep and minutes of sleep. I use this to try to identify if anything is messing with my sleep(like eating pizza too close to bed)

Things I use weekly but not daily

* timer: useful for when I walk away from the stove but when I don't want to turn off the oven for 5 minutes
* heartrate monitoring: It will tell me if I have a high heart rate and I'm not exercising. Useful for my anxiety so I can sit down and try to calm myself. 
* Something to read if I forget to bring my phone to the bathroom: I can check the news on my watch instead of just reading the back of a shampoo bottle",aquacarrot,26,0,2023-10-07 18:28:12,Apple Watch

"I barely use the notifications and have most of them turned off.  I don't need the distraction.

I have tachycardia, POTS, and heavy fatigue.  Tracking my heart rate, steps, and sleep is awesome.  I could also track steps with my phone in my pocket, though.

My heart rate was too fast for a fitbit to track reliably - it usually dropped mine by 30 - 60 points, making the measurement useless.  The newer apple watches have much better sensors.

So far the data from my phone has let me skip some cardiology tests (because I could just answer my doc's questions about my heart rate under different circumstances).  It can clue me in that I missed my POTS meds, and it has let me get faster sinus infection diagnoses.  It turns out I often get more tachycardic when I have a sinus infection, which has helped docs decide when they're on the fence about whether I need antibiotics.

I get lots of watch band compliments, but the most attractive metallic one snags on clothing and ruins it.

The added bonuses included checking texts without having to pull out my phone (obviously only at responsible times, not while caring for patients!!), heart rate monitoring (I don’t have cardiac issues but sometimes get a bit tachycardic, and like to keep an eye on my HR), and logging my activity, even just going on walks.

"I thought about it for a year before I pulled the trigger lol. It’s a bunch of small quality of life improvements that on their own wouldn’t be worth it but in the aggregate it absolutely is. 

-being able to check the time, weather, and calendar without having to whip out my phone 

-I use the timer for my breaks at work so I don’t have to keep track of time and can just relax; and for things like laundry cycles, face masks, etc

-can quickly check messages, notifs, incoming emails while I’m busy to see if they’re necessary for me to stop and respond or if they can wait. 

-while using gps my watch will vibrate a bit when a turn is coming up

-if I’m not near my phone when someone calls I can answer via my watch while I’m rushing to grab the phone lol

-it unlocks my MacBook so I’m not inputting a password or scanning my thumbprint so often

-APPLE PAY! I hardly have to get my phone or wallet out to pay for things anymore, just double-click the side button and hold it near the machine. It’s so much quicker and less touching of germy things. I just need more gas stations to adopt tap pay at the pumps! This one is huge, tbh, should probably be the first/top of the list lol. 

-it’s much more professional for me to check time, glance at a message, etc via a quick glance at my watch rather than whipping out my phone, especially in meetings. 

-my phone is black, and I have black leather furniture, so I “lose” my phone all the time lol. The feature to make my phone beep so I can find it is great lol. Since it connects to your phone, it also tells you if your phone is out of range for the features to work, so that’s saved me from leaving my phone somewhere a couple times too.

-I downloaded the Shazam app, it’ll listen to music and tell you the name and artist, and I use its watch app most of the time. That lets me be slick about not knowing haha.

The workout tracking is neat and all, but that stuff is almost as an aside. Mostly my dad and I have an informal contest on who has the most daily steps and staircase flights taken. He usually wins on steps, I win the staircases fyi. 😂

Question. I use google maps all the time..can i use it using apple watch?,coolbeb,2,0,2023-10-07 20:25:06,Apple Watch
"Omg I know exactly what you’re saying. I bought an Apple Watch 2 months ago after agonizing over the decision for at least a year. I wasn’t sure it was worth the money. I also was getting by without it, so why would I need it?

It’s incredible. 

Here’s how I use mine:
(First, a quick note that I have ALL notifications turned off on my phone except for texts, calendar events, our doorbell camera, and maps… too many distractions is too much during the day)

- I’ll start with the biggest thing that’s helped… Siri. On my wrist, ready for anything at any time. It’s incredible. Any time I have a random thought, I move my watch toward my mouth and Siri is automatically activated and I can just spout off whatever is on my mind. Here are a few examples… remind me in an hour to put clothes in the dryer, remind me this afternoon to follow up with (client), remind me (date) to call (person) about (thing), remind me tonight to ask (husband) about (thing). 

I also use it to make a note of random thoughts I have. I have Siri add it to my reminders but don’t add a time. That way, it doesn’t pop up as a notification later, but I have the idea somewhere I can access later. Like, remind me to figure out how to add automation to my airtable spreadsheet like I saw Britney do in hers, or remind me to watch (movie).

- I use timers all the time. I lose track of time so easily, so I set a time for 15 minutes during my morning routine to remind me when it’s time to be done reading so I can get in the shower and be ready in time for work. 

- Same for alarms. When something is really important, I set an alarm. For instance, I just have to love my wrist near my mouth to activate Siri, and I say set an alarm for 2:50 to pick up (daughter) from school, or set an alarm for 6 pm to start dinner. 

- I didn’t think losing my phone was an issue until I got my watch. I frequently can’t remember where I set my phone down. But my watch will make it beep, so I can find it quickly. 

- calendar notifications come straight to my wrist. I don’t always have my phone with me (I like to keep it in a different room when I’m working sometimes because it can be so tempting to pick it up). 

- texts come straight to my wrist. I can see who texted me and send a quick reply if needed without getting distracted by my phone. I can’t tell you how many times I’ll get a notification on my phone for a text and pick up my phone, then get distracted and forget what I’m doing and end up on Facebook or whatever. 

- I can check the time on my watch without picking up my phone and seeing notifications on my screen or being tempted to unlock it and get lost in whatever app. 

- it also has a flashlight which I thought was a gimmick but I’ve used my watch as a flash light so many times! Looking for socks in the dark so I don’t wake my husband, starting the keurig so I don’t have to turn on the kitchen light (it’s a little bright so early in the morning lol)

Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head. 

I got the S8 because of the fast charge option. I was going to get the SE, but I’m glad I spent a little more time I put it on the charger before getting in the shower every morning and it’s charged and ready to go by the time I’m dressed for work.",marvelousmrs,2,0,2023-10-07 20:33:40,Apple Watch

"I struggle with ADHD so I use it to remember things (meds and timers) and I use it for fitness. 

Fitness vs nutrition: Before the watch I was keeping a food diary and tracking my calories and weighing myself everyday, wondering if I’d taken things a step too far… it was exhausting and that effort is not sustainable for someone that struggles with consistency and routines. 

Once I had learned how to handle nutrition, the watch simplified fitness efforts into a life style instead of a rigid routine. I just try to close my rings 5 days a week.

Medication wise, it reminds me to take my medicine and now that I keep my daily dose in a scrunchie with a hidden zipper, I never forget.
I never forget a load of laundry in the washer or dryer now bc I can set a timer for it as soon as I start the cycle.

I like being woken by a vibration on my wrist vs a sound. 
I love being able to find my phone when it gets lost in the couch.
I also use it to replay 30s on whatever podcast or audiobook I’m listening to, bc it’s faster most of the time, and I don’t risk getting distracted by something else when I open my phone to rewind or replay.",companion86,2,0,2023-10-08 01:51:32,Apple Watch

I live with my apple watch - I feel naked without it.

  
I mainly use it to track my baby's activities, like diapers, sleep, and my pumping routine. I use Baby Day Book just in case any Moms out there are wondering. 

I also use it as a flashlight all the time haha - I try to keep the room dark for the baby but need to make sure I don't trip and fall on my way to the rocking chair.   


I walkie talkie my husband who also has his own watch - really nice when you have your hands full and don't want to text.   


I track how I spend my time - my setup is a little nuts, so I won't go into detail, but I always have a timer tracking how long something takes. It helps me stay focused and get more done. 

I track, water intake, steps, and workouts. I used to track sleep but I don't get enough sleep for it to work - I think you need to stay in bed for at least 4 hours.

I have it set to let me know when my heart rate gets above certain levels when I’m inactive. The mental health update for recording how you’re currently feeling is nice. 

Watch faces are great! You can have the weather on the face, like temperature or conditions outside. 

Alarms!!!! It’s great to sleep with. Best alarm I’ve ever had. It vibrates my wrist and doesn’t jolt me awake! And doesn’t wake my partner when they don’t need to wake up when I do.

The data shows I'm sleeping a total of 4-5 hours per-night, every night, averaged over the last 2 years. The *maximum* amount of time I have ever spent in REM sleep, is ~45 minutes. Even when I force myself to get 6, 7 and 8 hours of ""sleep"", that REM never tops 45 minutes. Most nights, it's 15-30 minutes. 

I have tried literally hundreds of treatments, including off-the-shelf, homeopathic, exercise/no exercise, start sleeping earlier/later, melatonin/no melatonin, caffeine/no caffeine, screens/no screens, darkening shades/no shades, brown/white/pink noise machines/no noise, and dozens of others. The quality and duration of my sleep hasn't changed at all, under any of the above scenarios. 

I finally asked my GP/MDO to look into the sleep issue, because it's directly impacting my ability to focus, concentrate and function at work. 

After some quick tests, he ruled out any any physical apnea as the result of blockages, snoring, etc. I used the Sleep Cycle app to record myself sleeping and there's very little to no snoring at all, only a few seconds over 4-6 hours of time in bed. 

He referred me to a top sleep specialist in the area, who looked at my data, my air pathways, listened to my heart and so on, and agreed, this was not apnea resulting from anything a CPAP would help with (which is the case for 90% of his patients), and there was no signs of narcolepsy. 

He ordered a sleep study, an *in-patient* sleep study, the type you check into a special hotel for 2 days to complete. They normally put you to sleep, wake you up, run all sorts of tests and so on over the course of the 2 days of tests. 

That sleep study was declined 3 times by my health insurance company, citing _""Insufficient data to justify the procedure.""_ 

I pay over $21k/year in health insurance premiums (in 2022/2023), to ensure I have good healthcare, low-to-no copays, PPO and so on. 

The sleep specialist had to resubmit the order for that sleep study *a total of 4 times*, before the health insurance company finally agreed to allow me to have the procedure and that they would pay for it. It has since been canceled and rescheduled 3 times, as they keep telling me different reasons why I can't fit into the schedule. 

It shouldn't be this hard to get treatment for what is clearly a dangerous health condition (likely [*central* apnea](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/central-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352109), not positional apnea). 

If I, with good health insurance, have to have years of detailed sleep data, a sleep specialist and have to have my doctors resubmit orders for tests _4 separate times_ only to have the request declined, I can't even imagine what others are going through who don't have the data, don't have good insurance and aren't persistent with their doctors about treatment. 

People are overworked, over-tired, and even if they needed to get treatment, the health industry is conspired against them. Their employers are also against them, as taking 2 days off to have the tests done, will eat into their sick time or holiday vacation, or worse, get them fired (thus ending their health insurance). 

It's a nightmare.",-rwsr-xr-x,70,0,2023-03-12 23:24:42,Apple Watch

"One of the two reasons I got the Apple Watch—the other being blood oxygen which was a ‘thing’ during Covid. Neither worked for me. I blame it on poor fit: I have thin wrists but large hands and the braided sport band barely made it over my hand while being loose around my wrist. This made for lousy skin contact for the sensors. It was bad enough that the red and green LEDs would wake me up when trying to do their measurements (side sleeper with left arm near face). I gave up and stopped wearing it to bed. 

To be fair to Apple, I’d stopped wearing a watch years before getting the Apple Watch (not much point when cellphones were more accurate and didn’t lend themselves to OCD time checking), so it wasn’t something I was used to.

Apple Watch is the perfect example of a subpar product released too early because Apple really wanted to be seen as being innovative. I'm willing to bet Apple Glasses will be the same; hamstrung from the start and forever in beta. Apple sucks hard at software.

I had a pulse watch 20years ago, the kind where I had to wear a band around my chest for it to work. I mean the gimmick was cool then, so was the step counters everyone had around the same time. but I don't see their usefulness?  
I check my health in the mirror, sometimes the scale. just do my workout fully oblivious to the numbers. if my feet are hurting I walked plenty today, fully without knowing if it was 10k or 20k steps.  
Everyone I know who wears a smart watch of any kind seems to struggle a lot more than those who don't. but that might as well be they're struggling more so they hoped this would help, just so far I haven't seen any evidence of it working.",RenaxTM,2,0,2023-09-18 20:17:19,Apple Watch

The Whoop band looks worse than the 41mm Apple Watch or the 40mm Galaxy Watch.

The Aura ring would be the logical choice, but it's good for some things and lacking or not as good for others. And some people hate rings like I do.

This first photo looks very strange and I don't believe it is advisable for the sensors unless you wear the actual watch facing your wrist. Weight would also be a concern to keep sensors in place.

Some watches like Casio have built-in biometrics, but they are very limited and not the best in most cases.

So the only options here are to look like an idiot for wearing a Smartwatch or to look like an idiot for wearing a Smartwatch on one wrist and a real watch on the other.

Sat down with some concentrates and took a dab, stood up, went to play video games, got an alert that my heart rate was high. Felt fine but it was just GOING. Thought huh I should go sit on my couch and just relax I guess.

Calmed down it all was fine, later that day took another dab, heart rate through the roof again. I’m like what the hell is going on?

Turns out that strain of Sativa was triggering panic attack reactions so every time I’d smoke it, my body would mimic a panic attack. Wildest thing I’ve ever experienced.

Edit: A lot of people are commenting that weed raises your heart rate. As someone who has smoked **heavily** for **years** this was absolutely wild and confirmed by doctors to be triggering a panic attack, far out of the realm of any standard heart rate increase for weed.",KrookedDoesStuff,67,0,2022-10-23 04:02:21,Apple Watch

"I wish Apple watches were compatible with Android phones. I'm wearing a Galaxy watch 4 and I'm not a fan.

1) I'm allergic to the watch back (I wore a Fitbit watch for years without problem)

2) it takes forever to charge (I timed it recently and it took an hour and 14 minutes to go from 14% to 97%)

3) 3 times now the Samsung Health ECG app has decided it needed updating and stopped working when I needed it, then took much fiddling around with to get working again (had to update app on phone, had to update app on watch, had to update watch as well.) Keep in mind I've had the watch less than 6 months. Also, each time this has happened it's lost all my previous data despite signing back into the same account. I've started emailing my ECG reports to myself so they don't get lost again

4) Because I'm so allergic to the watch back I had to fork out $50 for a leather band I don't even like, because it has a small hole for the sensor to contact the skin but the band covers the rest of the watch head. At least now I can keep wearing my watch in the one position rather than swapping arms, and inner/outer wrist positions multiple times a day

5) Because I had to buy a leather watch band I have to remember to take the watch off every time I shower/wash the dishes/wash my hands vigourously 

6) Both Samsung Pay and Google Wallet lock YOUR WHOLE WATCH and you need to put in a PIN to see the watch face every time you put your watch back on your wrist... That's fine - if you're only doing it once a day. Why the apps can't just lock the app instead of your whole damn watch is beyond me

"It does. In a way. You just have to manually configure it. 

-	On your watch, open Activity. 
-	On the first page (the one with the rings), scroll all the way down until you see Change Goals. 
-	You can set your Move goal to as low as **10 calories**, then tap Next. 
-	You can set your Exercise goal to as low as **5 minutes**, then tap next. 
-	You can set your Stand goal to as low as **6 hours**, then tap OK. 
-	Next, let’s tweak what you define as “exercise.” In the Workout app, you can start an Other workout with an open goal. Use this for doing simple tasks like getting out of bed to go to the bathroom, preparing breakfast for yourself, or things like that. Even simple things like this can fill that exercise ring quickly. 
-	Start your trips to the bathroom at around 58½ minutes past every other hour. This way you get Stand points for two consecutive hours with one trip. When a stand reminder pops up, ask Siri to start a timer for “8 and a half minutes.” (You can simply say the amount of time to get Siri to start a timer for that length.) Do this on the watch to receive haptic feedback to notify you when the timer runs out.

General advice: yes, buying used/open apple products can sometimes get you great deals, however the replicas products - especially airpods and watches are becoming almost indistinguishable compared to the originals, when it comes to pictures, of course.

"Sooo I have a question and thought in regards to this feature and additionally the Kardia mobile app, as anymore I see those commercials every other day. As someone with 20+ years experience in patient care. 

I am highly skeptical of Kardia mobile and this new apple watch detecting Atrial Fibrillation. I will admit I've not read through the litany of research studies and specific information related to these products. Just haven't had the time. This is merely my initial first thoughts: That these devices do successfully detect a heart rate, but after years of personally using and diagnosing heart rhythms via 3 and 4 lead EKG(s) that are so prone to the most minute of interference on devices that cost $10,000 to $20,000 or more. I am a little suspect of these new devices. My initial inclination and thought is that these new personal devices do indeed identify a heart rate that can inform the person of the rate, adivsing if it is slower or faster than normal or an irregular rate. But for a singe lead to be able to identify the source of the issue to be in the atria versus it potentially also being junctional or ventricular. As I think some else may have mentioned there also may be a heart block scenario causing the irregular rate.

For example even when diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation with a 3 or 4 lead EKG we often like a 12 lead EKG, which is more detailed view of the heart. These new devices represent a 1 lead EKG, while a 3/4 lead would be 4x magnified and 12 lead EKG being 10x (just rough numbers). So while this be can quite comforting for the potential patient/individual. These new devices aren't the same. I guess it summary it is similar to those who self diagnose through WebMD or the similar, however it is more useful and accurate that a pure self diagnosis.",SteelCityScouse,2,0,2022-06-07 12:54:21,Apple Watch

"i will tell folks here… i don’t ever think you’ll see a much bigger screen than what is currently on the Ultra 49mm and the Series 8 45mm for two main reasons…

1) I don’t think they will make the Ultra case bigger than the 49mm it currently is, and much of the extra space around the display is for protection of the display and for the overall look of the watch in this market segment. They could make the screen larger but it would change the look of the watch and or make it less protected, both of which are no goes.

2) I think the size of the screen is likely as large as it can go on almost any wrist and still look good. Even the 51mm giant Garmin Fenix 7X has just a 1.4 inch screen, the Ultra at 49mm already has a 1.91 mm screen! In order for the watch to look good on the wrist its not just the overall size, but also the lit up screen area… too big and it looks less like a watch every moment and more like a TV.",canyonblue737,2,0,2022-09-16 16:43:38,Apple Watch

"So I use CPAP at night, and I've been actively tracking my oxygen during sleep on CPAP.  I had always assumed my O2 would be good now that I was using a CPAP, but that's not always the case.  I found I was still having some nights with large dips in O2, not nearly as bad when I didn't have a CPAP. 

I picked up a [thumb/finger O2 Ring](https://getwellue.com/pages/o2ring-oxygen-monitor) so I can wear it comfortably while sleep.  The ring does continuous O2 & HR monitoring (4 second intervals) and will even vibrate along with the app sounding a horn to wake me if my O2 saturation drops below a threshold I set.

Since using it, I had my sleep therapist look at my drops, we made adjustments to my therapy settings, changed my pillow etc to ensure my airway stays open well.

Now I'm not seeing the large drops and even those that do happen are corrected in a few seconds due to the ring vibration waking me so I can shift position.

Jobs resigned from Apple about 7 months after the release of the iPad. And I'm guessing they didn't want to touch it while he was terminally ill. He died a little over a year after his resignation. By that time, the iPad had been without a Calculator app for nearly 2 years because of Jobs.

Simply put, one is grossly inaccurate for an Apple Watch and the other is displaying spurious accuracy.  

The fact is that simply carrying a phone can alter accuracy.  For that matter so can cloud cover, time of day, EM interference, or even solar flare activity (which was high a few weeks ago).  Beyond all of that, your new watch is only nominally more accurate at this sort of thing anyway.  It is not the point of dual GPS and, as real reviews demonstrate, the improvement in accuracy is a step up, not a leap forward (see [https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-in-depth-review-its-a-start.html](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-in-depth-review-its-a-start.html) as a good example). Look up how dual GPS actually works and, while you are at it, look up what pre-operational means.  That is the current status of the second network.   

Honestly, enjoy your watch since it is a major step forward for Apple.  People need to stop with the silly anecdotal stuff though since that is all we are seeing here.  I will pass on the subject of what path you actually walked. I will not pass though on the fact that there are so many variables involved that this sort of comparison is meaningless. Go buy a second watch and wear both if you want to see how one is performing vs the other.  Anything else is silly.  You will then see expected variations between older and newer technology (or different approaches to line smoothing).  If you get such radically different results, that speaks to issues with one watch since some divergence is to be expected but randomness is not.",[deleted],-2,0,2022-10-05 15:04:33,Apple Watch

The dude in this Tweet reminds me of that type of person, the type that isn’t even close to being rich but thinks they know what it’s like. It’s a dead give away when they quoted 150k as if that is big time. All of the owners of the company I work for are big watch collectors. They have spreadsheets that list all their watches and what they paid for each of them. I remember when the Pebble was first released as a kickstarter one of the owners wore one for a few weeks but stopped because he felt like all it did was give him notifications all day which drove him crazy. Then when the AW came out they all jumped on them for several months and then went back to their usual rotation. Then over the past few years they are almost exclusively wearing the AW unless they have plans directly after work or have a visitor coming to the office. There are three owners and after dividends effectively make around 35m/year each. Actually one of them wore a Fitbit on one arm for years. Such a child.

"TLDR: Apple Watch is a gadget, luxury watches are a piece of art. People don't wear them because they can do something, they wear them because they complement their outfit.

I love Apple Watch and I wear mine all the time. My girlfriend works in fashion, she designs dresses for top models and so on. Once I had a heated conversation about this with her. For me, it didn't make sense to buy (or wear) an extremely expensive watch that doesn't do anything. Her point is that you don't buy a luxury watch because of what it can do, but because of what it is.

A luxury watch is like a painting, it doesn't do anything, it's just beautiful to look at. But the thing is: what is the goal of the outfit you are wearing? Apple Watches are perfect for daily use, are perfect for workout, but when you want to wear something to impress, you are going on a date to a fine place, you have a special meeting, and so on, you should wear something that will complement your look, not something that is useful. People don't wear necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and so on, because they can do something, it is just because they are beautiful and make you look better. Also, a luxury watch is something you could buy once and use forever, even your kids or grandkids could wear it, while an Apple Watch will be outdated in a year.

That is a professional opinion from her, I ignored it and I never bought a luxury watch (at least for now), but now I understand the difference and I thought it was useful information to share.

She currently has a WiFi iPad and can FaceTime/GoogleMeet/Zoom with her friends while home on WiFi, but once away from WiFi communication is cut-off. Conversely that also applies for us as parents, if she's away from us and away from WiFi there's not many ways to communicate. 

Her Mom has an iPhone so we could set-it up under the family thing they talked about and approve numbers/etc. 

OTOH perhaps communicating with the watch is so cumbersome that it's just not worth considering unless it's an emergency situation. I've never used one, so I don't really know...

I could see a design that used magnets in order to ""place"" the watch band correctly and then the watch engaged a latch that secured the wrist band.

"Reason #5523 to go with an automatic for luxury watches.

“Apple’s original watch models, including the ridiculously expensive Edition versions, are now ‘obsolete’ — something that doesn’t happen to real luxury watches.

The Edition was Apple’s first attempt at competing with the luxury watch market, and the solid-gold version only lasted a year before Apple dropped it in favor of much cheaper (but not cheap!) ceramic and, later, titanium Editions. Most people don’t have Beyoncé or Lagerfeld money. Even folks who do drop five figures on watches tend to want something that’ll still tell time (and hold its value) in a couple of decades.

You could spend $10,000 to $30,000 on a Cartier Tank, still get a square watch, and not worry about whether you could get it serviced eight (or 80) years later. As long as luxury watch manufacturers like Cartier exist (or Patek Philippe, Rolex, etc.), you can get first-party repair service.”

"I think this is a massive update. Here’s why: 

1.	Workout plan API was much needed, glad to see TrainingPeaks will have it out of the box. I’m sure others will add this, so we can finally follow a schedule without having to manually add the workouts. And from there you can have your rest days, and it will all be available right on the Watch in the workout app. This is the second biggest update announced today. 

2.	I welcome the widgets design a ton, but I was hoping to see all the metrics I wanted on one screen to quickly glance at the data. But I welcome this nonetheless, and I’ll actually want to use the other watch faces again. I’ve been using Infograph for more than four years and nothing else lol. Another thing to note here is that the widgets will be interactive from the get-go, so this will be a massive productivity boost. 

3.	Glad to see power meter support for cycling. Garmin is on notice. 

4.	Offline maps support is coming to iPhone but Watch must be tethered to it to get them offline. Half step but an important one. POIs and difficulty levels are huge to see ahead of time. More creeping into Garmin territory here. 

5.	Apple Fitness+ is getting customized workout plans and schedules and stacks, and you’ll be able to raise and lower the music and instructor volumes. So again rest days will be here just not reflected in rings. 

6.	Motion sensor APIs will allow for great strength training apps and functionality that many on this sub are asking for. It’s coming, trust me, Strong and similar apps will feature this. Again, more Garmin territory taken, and an easy win to take from them because Garmin strength training rep detection is there but truly awful and inaccurate. 

7.	Apps will be able to display live workout data on the iPhone. I will find this handy for cycling and treadmill workouts when I’m not following an Apple Fitness+ workout. I love this.

8.	Apps are getting complete UI redesigns. The complications UI/icons are now used to go to different areas of the app instead of just relying on the arrow navigation. This will make apps contain more data and easier and quicker to get to. Think of them like tabs in iOS apps. 
9.	The Waypoint updates are huge, last cellular location and SOS call location are going to be so useful. 
10. Mental Health tracking is, IMO, a huge step towards health analysis. This will allow WatchOS to learn how what we log will generate the results we log. Daylight time logged is huge also and Apple needs the watch to measure this more than other devices. Sleep data is going to lead to analysis, I think fitness data will be next. 

Bonus - Snoopy

Mine is aluminium and it has scratches all over the screen and scrapes around the casing just from everyday usage. The damage occurred mostly when I get in and out of my car or my hand scrapes against a wall just walking and these things are bound to happen in your everyday life so I think it’s better to be safe and use a protective case.

My Series 0 had a sapphire screen, which remained in pristine conditions after 18 months, after that I have had four different Apple Watches with an normal glass screen, and every one of these four Apple Watches somehow got lots of scratches or even small dents on the screen. I kept each of them between one year and three years. I currently have a Series 7 that I brought with me for a road trip in the USA and I damaged it during a hike, the upper screen has a dent. 

The aluminium cases themselves have always been fine, the stainless steel case of my Series 0 however was quite scratched after 18 months.

"Depends on the model.

All SE and aluminum case Series Watches are… aluminum and Ion-X glass. Aluminum is a relatively soft metal and will therefore scratch and ding more easily. Ion-X is not as scratch resistant as synthetic sapphire crystal either. I’d recommend a bumper case for more impact prone activity and/or maybe a screen protector just in case. I accumulated some dings and faint scratches.

The steel and sapphire Series Watches are more scratch resistant, especially the screen, and the silver tone has the advantage that you could polish out scratches to the case if you have the tools and know-how. Maybe a bumper for impact prone activities. My brother’s series 7(?) still looks pristine.

The Ultra is the Ultra. The scratch resistant sapphire screen *and* a natural titanium case which is even more scratch and ding resistant, able to be polished and a flat screen less prone to bumps. You don’t need anything except *maybe* a slip on/off impact bumper *if* you’re feeling paranoid *and* actually doing something especially rough. You probably — overwhelmingly likely — don’t need anything at all. Aside from a band you don’t mind getting messed perhaps. I can’t seem to damage mine noticeably aside from with its own band’s titanium lug while changing bands in the dark. And I have to be looking for it to even find the mark. (I missed the groove and now have a *tiny* scuff at the point of impact.)

"My first watch was a Series 0 stainless steel. It held up for a good 5 years and eventually looked a little worse for wear but overall it still didn’t look that beat up — one deep scratch on the display I distinctly remember getting and quite a few scratches on the stainless, but these didn’t look terrible. 

Traded my series 0 for an aluminium series 5. The aluminium watch looked like total shit within months. I am not a careful person, i do not go out of my way to look after my things. Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t due to being incredibly clumsy. I drop everything I own and I bump up against walls and door frames constantly. 

The aluminium series 5 showed signs of wear very quickly. The display scratched, the aluminium showed deep scratches/chips/dents. Eventually I got used to it and stopped caring, but it always sort of bothered me how flimsy the aluminium models are. 

When I decided to upgrade to a series 8, I went with stainless again. Now I’ve had that series 8 gold stainless since a few weeks after launch and it looks as good as the day I bought it. No scratches, no dents. 

My point is — you can definitely tell the stainless steel models are made of tougher stuff. They hold up MUCH better to wear and tear.",-deflating,1,0,2023-08-28 17:59:48,Apple Watch

"I have owned 8 or 9 Apple Watches beginning with series two. All but one or two were used or refurbished.
All but one are/were steel (plus the titanium Ultra). All are/were cellular although I have not  used the cellular function on most of them. 

Now I have an Ultra, a 7, a 6 and a 3 (not worth selling or getting rid of the older ones although I have gifted 3 or so and I have a couple or 3 of iPhones to which the older watches are paired). 

The steel cases have gotten some light scratches that easily polished out. I have had silver, gold and black stainless finishes. 

I have/had screen protectors on the Ultra and one or so of the other watches. I have never had a scratch on a screen protected or otherwise. 

The only issue I have had with any of them was a 6 that I bought on eBay that would not connect to cellular because it was not cleared properly before it was pawned although I used it with Wi-Fi and BT.

I’m 48 don’t smoke or drink fit and exercise every day. I went into AFib about 16 months ago. I instantly knew something was wrong. It felt like my heart was tumbling in my chest. Checked with my AW and I was in it and heart rate was something like 168-190 bpm. Went to the ER they gave me some meds and a few hours later I was back to sinus. Cardiologist prescribed a pill in a pocket of Flecainide and Bisop to be take when and if I ever went back in and to see him in 3 months. In the mean time I’d go into it ever few days to 2 weeks. So when I saw him again he recommended I take the Flecainide and Bisop everyday or I could have an ablation. He said ablation only has a 70% success rate and might be done up to 3 times. I decided on the meds. Not had AFib since but don’t know what the long term ramifications of staying on Flecainide and Bisop. I’ll be seeing the cardiologist again soon and will see if I can go off the meds and see if the AFib returns. The Apple Watch did detect AFib on its own when I was in it and asleep before I took the meds on a daily basis. luckily For me I was very symptomatic when I was in AFib.

"I had this EXACT same thing. In June I was driving home and I felt extremely dizzy. Didn't think much until I woke up the next day dizzy. Went to work like usual and got this same ""Afib warning"". Went to the hospital just to get checked out because I was born with SVTs and had me scared. Was in afib while at the hospital. My resting heart rate was 110 for 3 days straight. I got on a heart monitor for 2 weeks. Got the results from that and I was in afib 80% of that 2 weeks wearing it. It went away for a few months until I went to get a heart stress test done last week and it came back in the middle of the test. I have been working with multiple doctors and taking multiple EKGs for this and should be getting an ablation within the next few months. Its scarry, But I thank my watch for showing me this and helping me get it fixed. Before this happened I wore my watch maybe a few times a month.

I also like the longer battery life, especially on days I go for a run and am listening to music. I have a smaller wrist for a guy, but I don’t feel like it is too big either: pictures definitely make it seem larger than it feels like in person.

"No. It was not worth it for me.

- The battery life was amazing.

- The screen was nice with its extra brightness and flatness.

- The extra durability was reassuring.

- I love titanium.

But I sold it and bought a stainless series 8. The Ultra did not look big on me, but it felt a little big. It’s too thick so it was annoying whenever I wear long sleeves, hoodies, and dress shirts which I wear the majority of the time. It was not comfortable to sleep in especially if I put my arm under my pillow. I didn’t like the feeling of the crown guard. The titanium edges next to the screen are a little sharp. I don’t like the look of the cellular bands that wrap the edges. I love orange, but not on one button for my everyday watch. 

The stainless series 8 is more comfortable for me. Not only is it lighter and slimmer, but the roundedness let it slide in and out of clothes easier and glance off of objects easier. I think both watches are beautiful but I honestly prefer the look of the stainless 8 over the ultra. More simple, sleek, and classy. 

The only thing I kind of miss is the battery, but I just charge the 8 when I shower and dress in the morning and sometimes when I’m at work, and I haven’t had an issue.",tittysprinkle9000,91,0,2023-08-24 19:44:49,Apple Watch
Personally for me it wasn’t worth it. I only wear mine to work each day and if I’m doing anything physical especially remote hiking I use my Garmin.

Its fucking expensive, the waterproof is great but doesn’t get as deep compared to others on the market. The 3 day battery is low compared to a week long battery on other watches.

One is stainless steel Apple Watch looks better and with DLC coating it scratches lesser than the Titanium on the Ultra.

"Love mine. I’m used to 55mm faced watches. So, the 49mm isn’t too big to me. Battery life is honestly impressive. It’s durable. Taken a few bumps. Still have smooth glass without a screen protector. I use the action button as an immediate flashlight, and that thing has come in handy in a real pinch more times than I can count. I like the exclusive Wayfinder watch face because at a twist of the crown it turns the face to dark mode. Basically giving you two faces in one. It’s super slick looking and very tactical if you’re a person who works in the dark or maybe law enforcement. It may not seem like it, but it’s considerably bigger than the 44-45 Apple Watch. I can’t imagine wearing anything smaller than a 49mm watch, but that’s a personal preference. All that being said, it has failed to wake me up, which is the reason I bought it to begin with.

My only criticism is the battery is starting to fade already - I used to get well over 2 days and now I'm barely getting 2 - not sure if it's degradation, unintentional software updates or Apple being pricks and intentionally doing it. Who's to say anymore ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

It's expensive and therefore requires certain commitment for the product but if you've loved older apple watches you can't go wrong with Ultra either.

Last year I was training for the Chicago Marathon with the Fenix 6X and I got the Ultra on launch day. I did a couple shorter runs with it to test it out and decided to use it for the marathon.  The multiband GPS is similar to the newer Garmins and is a lot better than the older watches. It was solid for the Chicago Marathon. 

I haven’t done swimming or cycling with it but I hope to get back into that next year. 

The battery life is way better than the old Apple Watches but still has a ways to go to catch up to Garmin. I miss my Garmin’s battery if I’m going somewhere for 3+ days but carrying a charger with me isn’t a hassle.

"It was worth it to me.

I got it at launch and been wearing it every day. Reading this sub, there are two types of Ultra users - those who use it to the fullest degree that was intended, so like exercise, hiking, water, etc and those who simply use it as a watch. Nothing wrong with either, but for me, I used it for working out and swimming. 

When I had my previous watch, I was always on edge that I would break my watch when I was lifting or that I would bang it against some stupid wall or something. Since buying the Ultra, I haven't had that worry. There was a time early on I did bang it pretty hard accidentally against a wall...and nothing. Scratched it from a screw in a workout machine...and nothing. Scratched it on a tool when cutting bushes outside...and nothing. Dirt while gardening....and nothing. Hiking and rubbed against a rock...and nothing. Playing in the pool and banged on the edge...and nothing. This can take a serious beating and still functions. After a year, the screen is smooth and the frame is like brand new.

Do other watches have this type of scratch resistant glass, like Garmin? YES, but on the second point, I use it fully as a smart watch. I text from it, I get important emails, I use maps, i use the phone app, notifications from my apps, i even used the walkie talkie app (i know, it's a thing), etc. On top of that, the app store still cant' be beat since there are some really great apps that utilize Apple watch that I use on a daily basis. Other Apple watches utilize all that I mention, granted, so I tend to look at it as an extension to the real point of that is better suited to my needs in the sports/activities aspect. 

Yes, the battery life is amazing. It definitely was a selling point, and it has really helped. I tend to forget to charge it, but then I check it and it still has ~55% battery life the next day.

But for me, even though the screen is only slightly larger, and only slightly flatter, and only slightly brighter, and only slightly different button styles ... the aggregate experience, for me, is one that is such an elevation over the previous watches I had (Series 0, 4, 5, 7) that is really is a joy to use.

The fact that it's also a better outdoors watch (I do a lot of trail running in the mountains, etc) almost feels like a nice bonus.

"The moment they open watch face design to app developers, the market will flood with better designs. A simple App Store for watch faces at 29¢ or something would be fine by me.

One of the reasons for the limited selection is compatibility. An Apple Watch 6 can’t do some of what an 8 can do, so things are designed to run on the lowest common denominator of what is currently supported. You can’t have 7 or more complications on older models.

Something as simple as a better self-designer for watch faces would be ideal. Let me position and size complications around the face.

"Regarding the display size: 

>I estimate that Apple’s pro watch will have a case size of 46mm or 47mm to squeeze in a screen that offers about 7% more area than the 45mm Apple Watch Series 7.

Gurman [previously claimed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-06/apple-plans-extreme-sports-watch-with-larger-screen-metal-case) that the Apple Watch ""Pro"" would have a resolution of around 410 × 502 pixels. The Apple Watch Series 7 has the following resolutions: 

* 41 mm: 352 × 430 pixels 
* 45 mm: 396 × 484 pixels 

A 410 × 502 display will be 3.5% wider and 3.7% taller than the 45 mm Series 7, assuming the same pixel density (and ignoring the rounded corners). 

Speculation on the price: 

>But how much will a new pro Apple Watch cost? I think we start at the current Apple Watch Edition to figure that out. Today’s Apple Watch Edition is essentially an Apple Watch Series 7 in a titanium case instead of aluminum or stainless steel. The 45mm Edition starts at $849.

"It will only be ""Pro"" if it's an actual sports watch, and not just cosmetic upgrades from the current AW, which at its heart is an excellent smart watch with activity and health monitoring features. It doesn't have a native training focus at all.  For example a key feature of the AW is to complete the rings - including 30 min of daily exercise. In serious training taking a day off is a positive and necessary thing because the body needs a rest now and then. In AW world though, take a day off an you lose a streak. Totally counterproductive to the mission.

For me to buy, a ""Pro"" model needs

1. metrics equal or better than the top Garmin watches like Forerunner 955, Fenix 7 and an improved ""fitness"" app -- maybe renamed ""training"" to display this data.
2. to have a ""training"" mindset and having things like noting if a workout was a net positive, a junk workout, or neutral; a body battery to suggest when to take a slow day or a no day.; notification comparing performance of a current run to the last run. These are all things even basic Garmin watches have done for a few years now.
3. to remain lightweight, even if ruggedized. If I can notice my watch then it's too heavy. In a fashion watch heft is good. In running, it's just off balancing.
4. Days long battery life.

As for price - I've never paid more than $350 for an AW because that's all they are worth to me. I have paid $600 for my Garmins because they are worth that to me. So to have one watch that does it all I would gladly pay $800. But it has to add all of the above otherwise I'm happy with my Series 6 until it dies.",Naughtagan,2,0,2022-07-11 13:20:09,Apple Watch

"I’m a drummer and drummer teacher by profession. When it comes to teaching, the Apple Watch is invaluable to me. 

The studio I teach at has the drum kit set up far away from the mixing desk, which is where I have my iPhone connected to for music playback for my students. I use my watch to stop/pause the music often when in a lesson when a student makes a mistake or I need to explain/jump in and demonstrate something. It saves me having to keep walking across the room to my phone each time. As a result, it keeps the lesson more fluid………I also use the timer feature, so I get a subtle tap on the wrist  when it’s time to wrap up the lesson.

Besides that, I enjoy the sleep tracking and fitness features, reading messages without having to get my phone out and checking my calendar to see the days teaching schedule at a glance.

The Apple Watch is the main reason why I could never leave Apples ecosystem, despite how tempting some of those Android folding phones look.",drummerdave72,32,0,2023-07-30 05:40:26,Apple Watch
"My perspective as someone who didn’t really see the point but was mildly curious and was gifted one a few months ago:

It’s really useful for traveling, both for short daily errands and for proper trips, to the point that I’m surprised this is not mentioned often by other users or in marketing material. If I go somewhere on foot, by bike or by car I get maps on my wrist and vibrating notifications when I need to turn. If I’m taking public transport I get vibrating notifications when I need to transfer and I look at my wrist to see to what platform or stop I need to go. If I’m taking the train, it shows my itinerary and the QR code for my ticket. If I’m flying, it shows the QR code for my boarding pass. All the while, if I’m listening to something I can use the watch to control playback, not just the basic play/pause/next/previous from the built-in controls in my headphones, I can see what’s playing, choose a different playlist or album, skip ahead or backwards in podcasts…

Apart from that, notifications, and voice-controlled alarms and timers, and to-do lists on your wrist can be pretty convenient and nicer than keeping your phone nearby and have it shout at you to while waking up for sleep or cooking with a timer, or than keeping your phone (or a piece of paper) in your hand continuously while shopping to look at your grocery list and cross things off.

I’m not particularly into fitness, but I do cycle to work and sometimes for leisure and occasionally hike or swim or kayak, and the combination of maps on your wrist, heart rate monitoring and GPS track recording (also while in or on the water without fearing to lose my phone in the depths) is nice. Seeing what fitness zone I’m in while cycling and, afterwards, how my heart rate changed during the cycle and after, is nice, although I’m not training for anything so it doesn’t have a purpose, strictly speaking.

I also use Apple Pay quite a bit, but honestly it’s a very mild convenience; I could take out my phone from my pocket and use it to pay in about the same time. Unlike using Wallet on the watch for tickets and boarding passes, which often happens when I’m walking or my hands are full or it’s hard to fish out my phone for whatever reason, I find that when I pay for things I can usually grab my phone from my front pocket in about a second.",mbrevitas,16,0,2023-07-30 09:07:38,Apple Watch

I find it handy that I can leave my phone in my bedroom and still get calls texts on my watch. Never have to worry about missing something and I leave my phone on vibrate all the time. What really made me buy the watch is my job. We’re not allowed to bring our phones in so I got an Apple Watch. It’s a GPS/WiFi only so I don’t get calls at work but I just use it to check the time and to track activity. I was initially bothered that I didn’t have a phone to check the time. It also can be used to control music (and even download music natively). And I’ve showed pictures to coworkers using my watch.

"I hadn’t worn a watch since jr high. Decades of no watch on arm. Then during pandemic at one point noticed I was short on breath doing stuff I always do (walking a few blocks). A friend suggested an oxygen meter. Those are not expensive but I figured why not just buy an AW? I never really thought I needed one but why not? I had extra money and do love new toys. 

I love it. At work I’ll see email previews right on it easy peasy and decide if I need to get phone out or head back to office computer or just wait. I often use a calculator at work and having one on my wrist is way better than pulling my phone out. Being able to respond to an iMessage without getting my phone out is nice. Ability to answer a quick phone call is great. Nice to be able to do alarms or a stopwatch. Has actually been worth it at work. And I doubt if I’m using the watch to full potential. Rarely wear it at home. Always at work. Often but not always when out like for groceries or shopping. 

I do want to start wearing it when sleeping, been having issues sleeping lately. But I tried a few times and just couldn’t get used to feeling it when trying to fall asleep. 

Oh, also nice to quickly check my oxygen level. I was fine, perhaps just worn down or a tad stressed. Perhaps had a super mild case of Covid. But I was fine.

1. Not needing to have your phone always BY you. 
Wearing my Apple Watch means I hardly pick up my phone “just to check for any notifications” but then getting sucked into the vortex of “just doing” fifty other justifiable To Dos, and thus losing an hour. The watch allows me to monitor the truly important notifications as they arise, while giving me independence from my phone itself.
2. If you really do intend to do something about your fitness — the Apple Watch is a fantastic way to track your progress, set your goals, monitor your habits, stay accountable, keep motivated, and get nerdy with all the data and stats.

Other things I LOVE about my watch — having the security of an emergency call button right at hand. Being able to answer calls or send messages or set reminders or use Siri at my wrist without having to go find my phone or stop my activity / workout. My affirmations app which greets me with positive messages every time I glance at the watch. Being easily able to control music as I run. The security of knowing my heart rate is being unobtrusively monitored, and also my safety when driving or walking. (Crashes, falls) I love being able to see my menstrual cycle charted out according to my temp. I love the mindful app and the reminders to stand and breathe and be mindful.",CitrinetheQueen,1,0,2023-07-30 08:57:12,Apple Watch
"I’m planning to get very soon! I got pulled in by these two main features:
Silent vibration alarm so I don’t wake my partner up

Notifications on my wrist and the ability to reply - my life is pretty hectic and I can’t look at my phone sometimes. The latter is really why I want to go with Apple! Otherwise xiaomi watch would suffice too. 

Apart from that it’s just a bunch of nice to have features like the ability to remote control camera. another easy way to change music, Apple Pay, sleep tracking, find my iPhone etc. 

I’m excited! I contemplated getting a cheaper one from xiaomi which looks amazing too but I figure the features would be more limited when paired with iPhone.",avocadoooss,1,0,2023-07-30 09:14:04,Apple Watch

"As a watch mainly. Not being sarcastic but I have worn watches since I was about 12 and feel naked without one.  Before the Apple Watch I wore a fitness tracker and a regular watch for normal use and a smart watch for exercise. The main reason for buying an Apple Watch  was to consolidate this into a single device that was more integrated with my iPhone. 

Apart from this I measure my vitals, especially during exercise, and notifications so I don’t need to look at my phone but these need a lot of tuning.",fahim-sabir,1,0,2023-07-30 09:50:10,Apple Watch

To remote control AppleMusic so I don’t have to dig out my phone to change songs, add them to my library or a playlist etc. The watch app is very capable. And I hope it stays that capable on watchOS 10. Apple doesn’t have a good record on that particular watch app.

With the Watch, I can stream podcasts and music without making surprise phone calls with my sweat.

Was gifted an AppleWatch months ago and still haven’t found any real use for it.

"My use is super simple:

1. Prioritized notifications: My phone is always on silent and gets all the notifications for the apps, but my watch gets the ones I need to know about ASAP, such as messages, calls, reminders, and calendar notifications
2. Fitness: I track all my workouts with it to monitor my progress & improve. Also I like have a heart rate monitor and also use the breathe app alot.
3. At A Glance Info: My watch has the time, date, weather, and next calendar event on the watch face. Comes in handy alot.
4. The Small Things: Not a huge deal, but super nice to have my music controls on my watch face or have Apple Pay - things where using the phone's my main, but sometimes it's tucked away or at my desk or whatever and boop, it's on my wrist too.

"I had the 1st apple watch, and I'm sure they're way better now.

I loved it for paying for things (easy peasy!) and I thought the dictation on the watch was so amazing (I don't know why, but it was WAY Better than just the iPhone alone). I really don't understand the dictation one, maybe it was a fluke (or they're the same now).

With that said, I got rid of it, because I felt like I was CONSTANTLY tethered to beeping and buzzing (I know, I can turn notifications off). It almost felt like I was chained to being online, with no escape. Dramatic, I know.

I may revisit it, now that Notifications are probably much more customizable, etc. I would love a good sleep tracker and/or steps and all that jazz. But the 1st generation didn't have a long enough battery to sleep with and use during day, so I thought all the downsides overrode the need to keep it.

I don't think this post is very helpful, but I'm happy to hear anyone's similar or ""You're crazy, go get the newest one now... they're awesome!""",BearlyGrowingWizard,1,0,2023-07-30 11:05:07,Apple Watch
"* Notifications
* Recording heart rate
* Recording Workouts
* Recording Sleep
* Setting timers & reminders
* To see what time it is
* Weather widget to see what the temperature is outside without having to open an app
* Use the Noise widget to make sure I don't play music in the car to loud (have kids so want to make sure its a safe noise level for them)
* Can control music from the watch while on runs/ in the car and adjust volume on my AirPods

I really try to live a healthy life style and the Apple Watch helps me with that. It's also nice not having to pull my phone out every time I get a notification.

"Many purposes. A lot of them. I’ll list most of them at the end, but I’ll focus on the most important one for me, and on the second most important:

* health
* Apple Pay

Health: I suffer from AF (atrial fibrillation).

My AF was diagnosed by the AW itself, and confirmed by the doctors. I begun taking meds since.

The AW helps me to follow the AF evolution accordingly to my life style. I’ve managed to lower the frequency of AF episodes, duration, and intensity, with the help of my AW. I’ve found out that my weight and regular exercise are directly connected to my AF episodes. When I exercise everyday, my AF episodes are rare. When I stop exercising, the AF episodes become more frequent, more intense, and longer.

The AW also helps with the exercising part. Being able to set goals for daily exercise, and being able to measure it, helps to get the required daily exercise to keep my AF controlled.

Apple Pay is currently my main method of payment. For payments online I use the iPhone or Mac, but on day-to-day payments IRL I use my Apple Watch. I pay for groceries, meals, services, etc.

It’s also helpful for authentication on the Mac, to receive notifications about incoming messages (mail, SMS, and other apps) and being able to reply to them, calendar events, alarms, tasks, tracking meds intake, make and receive calls, etc.",Zen13_,1,0,2023-07-30 11:40:56,Apple Watch

I paid about the same I would for a brand new Apple Watch and it looks great, I enjoy wearing it, and the battery is a non-issue.  

While it doesn’t track my sleep habits, heart rate and steps, I found that just listening to and taking care of my body is something I can do on my own.  As far as the other features are concerned, I never really used them enough to justify wearing one, when my phone can do everything the watch does but better and it’s one less device I need to worry about charging.",Nynebreaker,1,0,2023-07-30 12:02:30,Apple Watch

"I'd  stayed away from the apple watch until the functionality was somewhat complete. I had smart watches before but didn't like them much. Since I got the apple watch though, I'm using it all the time.

For me, it's mostly a health and fitness tool. Even if you don't need the fitness aspect, it's nice to have (good) data about sleep, stress, heart etc. Fitness tracking is quite good and becoming even better soon, I'm kindof hoping it'll be replacing my Garmin cycle computer. I already leave the garmin at home for casual rides and only really use it for longer road bike rides (where I have a power meter which is not yet compatible with the watch). It's just super nice to have one device that does it all.

Additional benefits I hadn't even considered before buying: Being able to leave your phone somewhere in the house and still be able to pick up phone calls; Unlocking the macbook, using my renpho scale without having my iphone in the bathroom, weather forecasts at a glance, setting alarms without picking up the phone, quickly setting timers while cooking, controlling smart home stuff without the phone, etc.

Edit: Oh, forgot apple pay and media control. I do not use regular smart watch stuff (notifications etc.) much and have turned most of that off. It can stress you out to have a buzzing wrist every 5 seconds.

So in summary: You don't \*need\* it. But once you have it, it's very easy to get very used to it very quickly.",gxrphoto,1,0,2023-07-30 12:21:31,Apple Watch

I was happy with my Fitbit for years, didn’t think i ”needed” an Apple Watch, but it has so exceeded my expectations for usefulness. The two biggest standouts for me have been medication reminders and biometric tracking. It actually told me to take a day off from working out and chill because my heart was doing weird things (I have dysautonomia, managed by physicians, I do not recommend relying on a watch for cardiac health management).

That’s the biggest feature in my opinion. Step tracking, workout tracking, the ability to look back on health trends, see your resting heart rate decline as you get fitter.

Being able to view notifications without pulling out my phone is a godsend in meetings or when I’m out seeing clients.

Sleep tracking is a really neat feature I use to keep track of my sleeping habits and try to improve upon them.

The fitness isn’t something I really use since I don’t really do much moving around. But during the weekend my girlfriend and I will usually go on a walk or a hike and it’s nice viewing the stats collected during our walk.

Not being tethered to my phone. Granted, I usually have my phone on me 24/7, but now I have the option to not be tethered to my phone if I desire that.

"TLDR: ADHD, PTSD, CND and asthma aid. I don’t do things with it. It does things for me. 

I originally got it to assist me with severe unmedicated ADHD and I was so nervous that this was another of those things my brain would find useful for a bit and then turn invisible. Focus disorders are relentless, but…

It actually worked out perfect. Having a gentle time strapped to my wrist helps me actually feel time moving and stay a little more with it. Reminders on my phone were just another notification in a sea of them that turned invisible to my brain but not on the watch. Being able to just tell Siri hey add a timer, reminder, alarm, etc has been amazing and the find my phone works better than the find my phone app. 

BUT THATS NOT ALL

Got it for ADHD and it ended up really come through for me on the health front.

I have severe C-PTSD which is a nice way of saying my brain occasionally takes me on road trips to terrible places and I dissociate, losing all touch with the world around me. This thing did a thing I didn’t know it could do- my heart rate shot up while I was just sitting here unmoving and my watch sent me a hepatic alert. It actually yanked me out of a panic attack. It’s happened twice in the last year and a third time when I was trying a new med that had an adverse reaction on me. Bloody helpful. 

BUT WAIT THERES MORE!

9 months ago I woke up with stabbing pain in my spine. We knew something was wrong and it started 9 months of visiting Drs to just recently learn I have a central nervous system disorder (I’m collecting disorders like Pokémon apparently). Watch couldn’t help with that part but it did help with the next one. 

Between my watch and my phone (which wasn’t as reliable unless it was in my back pocket) the health app was collecting a lot of data on my walking steadiness. Not only does it now alert me if my walk is getting bad enough to instigate a fall but we were able to go back through all that data and find patterns which helped a smidge with my diagnosis but helped a lot in getting medical professionals to take me seriously.

Bonus points for this last one: I came out of the shower and had an asthma attack. My walking went funny and I couldn’t reach my cane to walk out to the living room and grab my inhaler.

I was able to hit a butting and connect with my husband on the other side of the house and get help. 

These days I also use it to see the air quality index, alert me if my local allergens are higher than usual and keep and eye on my sleep. 

It’s made going through a life changing disability easier than it could have been.

Aside from that use Siri for reminders and create events in calendar. I mostly use my phone for this though. 

I also use it so set timers (the most useful thing to me) almost exclusively. I don’t use the stopwatch but I barely use it over all. 

For exercise related things, I do use it for weight lifting but I don’t really like it and I have been skipping it but I do use it when I go for walks, biking or running. I can’t go running without it since I like to know my max distance so I can compare my time per mile to the previous week. 

I like smartwatches because I can change the watch face, so it feels like I have a new watch without having to buy one. To me that’s cheaper than buying various watch since I only have one now, and can feel like new each time. Having said that I don’t like that Apple are the only one that can create watch faces (don’t quote me on this) and that’s one thing I miss about the Fitbit or Samsung watch, there’s more variety and for the Fitbit I was able to do my own (not an expert in UX but I could have my favorite movie poster on the back lol)

I used to use it to pause videos, but that’s is next to useless to me, it would better for the iPad but to be fair I haven’t tried if it’s possible to do. 

When it comes to notifications I don’t really care and I turn it off for most apps. Same with the phone. It is useful for messaging apps but most of the time I tend to ignore them. 


But to keep it short, mostly use it as a watch and a fitness tracker exclusively for running and sometimes biking. I use it to create timers, something I barely use my phone now, create reminders and events on the calendar using Siri.

Edit:

Something I forgot that using the watch for directions when driving is freaking cool, I wish Apple Maps didn’t suck in PR.

"Notifications  - Not from all apps, but more important things such as calls, messages, emails, and other messengers that you care) 

Activity monitoring - Good to track your activity and Good for motivation

Weather condition - For some reason, I am a very weather-sensitive guy so it's very handy to check the weather at a glance. 

Timer - For focus time or cooking I use the timer a lot.

Music control - You can control what's playing on your iphone. 

Applepay - Spending your money will get much easier :)

Some killer apps - I train corssfit and I use Atlon that is dedicated for corssfit workout. I cannot work out without this app. You will find your killer apps after using an Apple watch. 

Unlocking your mac - It's not an app but a feature. You can unlock your mac without taking any action.

"Where I work we “arent allowed” to be on our phones”. People still do it to check the time or to navigate our music playlists (we are allowed to play music through our earbud).
Havjng the 🍎 Watch is handy to handy to do just that without getting “in trouble”. 
(I know it sounds juvenile but “they” really dont “care” they just reinforce it from time to time or they use it against you if you are a shitty worker or troublemaker.)

I also use it to track my pulse when I work out. Try to keep it above 120 whenever I lift. Back to back supersets and finish off with drop sets.

You sound like you are plugged into the 🍎 Ecosystem more than I AM! I personally prefer Google Maps, gmail, and Spotify, instead of apple maps, apple email, and iTunes. So my watch doesnt seamlesslynintegrate like it wants to. It keeps wantkng to pull up apple maps when i drive, efc.

I know that, ironically, the one thing Apple keeps reminding people Apple Watches can’t do is detect a heart attack. But I figure having a bunch of data can’t hurt. Seriously: *anything* can be a symptom of a heart attack and meanwhile *nothing* you can do at home can conclusively rule out a heart attack.

"Honestly, I felt the same as you and put off getting one until I got a good deal on a Series 7 last year. Long story short, I’m an Apple Watch convert. 

The fitness features are what sold me on it. I love using it for workouts and knowing exactly how many calories I’ve burnt each day. It actually inspires me to be active if I see that I haven’t burnt as many as I like (and I’m a pretty casual fitness person imo).

The other features are nice but aren’t really why I wear it. I like getting notifications, but I have it set up so that only the most important notifications come through. I don’t want my wrist buzzing all day.

On top of that, I think it looks pretty nice. I bought a leather band from Amazon and always use a pretty minimal watch face.",noeyescansee,1,0,2023-07-30 17:14:16,Apple Watch

"For me, the major use case is reminding myself of what I’ve got planned/what I need to do. As someone with ADHD, this is a life saver. 

Of course, you don’t need an Apple Watch to accomplish these things. But having my calendar and to-do’s on my wrist means they’re always there. If I’m checking the time, date, or temperature, I’ll also be reminded of where I need to be at any given time, or what I’ve yet to do for the day. 

It’s also been helpful for reducing wasted screen time on my phone. Doom scrolling is a big problem whenever I open the thing, so I attempt to keep it to a minimum. If I ever misplace the damn thing (something that happens quite frequently) it’s also nice to be able to locate it with the loud ping I can send from the watch.",DrDetox,1,0,2023-07-30 17:25:50,Apple Watch
"Originally (and still do to some degree) it was to know if a notification needs dealing with right now (high priority) or can wait when at work.

Without boring you with the details, it wasn’t ok for anyone else to have their phones out at work, and whilst I was allowed I thought it best to lead by example where I could. So I’d look at my watch and if it wasn’t urgent, I’d ignore. If it was, I’d head out back and deal with it. 

That was with an Apple Watch 3 and it last me many, many years. I now cannot live without it and do not wear any other watches, except for exercise. 

I found the AW3 to be poor for running gps, certainly against my garmin. However I have had an AW8 since they were released and I find that fine for short/medium distance.

Apple Pay on watch without having to take your phone out is a game changer. So easy to check out at a store, especially if your hands are full. And I use it daily in place of a metrocard on the NYC subway - so easy to just breeze through without having to flash my phone around. 

Glancing at it for text or email notifications are also a game changer since you can immediately see if something is important and worth grabbing your phone for or if it can wait. 

Find my iPhone, clutch. I use timers with haptic alarm for cooking almost daily. Music controls. Glancing at the weather. 

And it’s not your priority, but the fitness and health stuff really is incredible. Even if you don’t have a workout regimen (and maybe especially if you don’t), the activity rings are so beneficial for things like reminding you to stand up and reach basic levels of daily movement goals for being a normal healthy person.

Activity tracking: I’m a long distance runner and gym enthusiast. I have been using Apple Watch to track for about 4 years, so I have much history. Honestly, I wish I could take my history and switch it to Garmin for longer runs, but the Apple Watch has proved worth, especially the Series 7.

Nurse: I have many tasks happening simultaneously while caring for 15-20 patients. Some ask for pain meds when they aren’t do, some require certain medications before appointments, etc. I will set reminders, “Hey Siri, remind me to give 41 pain meds at 1630” or, “hey Siri, set a 4hr timer”

EKG, HR, VO2 Max: these metrics while not being entirely accurate — mostly due to the limitations of the tech being on watch with limited sensors — give an amazing insight in physiologic progress after time of exercising. 

Calls & Texts: again, I work in a very busy profession, that at times, im unable to sit for 4-5 hours with situations evolving on the time. I am however, also a father and husband, so with the watch, I can see texts my wife sends me during work. Gives me an idea of what she’s talking about and if I need to respond or I can finish what needs to be finished.

Calculator: sometimes it’s all I got when I do wanna go search for my phone haha

Flashlight: you know you do too

Weather: I have it set on my watch face, so I glance at that often.

"I bought an Apple Watch a few months ago and found myself using the NBA app quite often to check match scores. I'm a software engineer, so it didn't take long for me to wonder if I could build something similar for Dota. After a few months of working on it in my free time, I think I finally have something useful.

The app fetches match data every few seconds and includes

* Recently finished matches
* Live matches
* Kills scores
* Minimap
* Player's respawn timer
* Win probability chart
* Networth information, including players' inventory

The only downside is that the match data is usually delayed by 2\~15min (depending on the tournament), so it's always behind official streams. But considering the whole point of the app is to use it when I can't watch the matches, I think it's good enough.

I currently have it available as a beta app if anyone is interested in trying it out. All I ask in return is for feedback on the app (even if you try it and don't find it useful)

"[Here’s a link the the press release with more information.](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/09/introducing-apple-watch-ultra/)

“Apple Watch Ultra is designed for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters with the new Oceanic+ app. To support these underwater adventures, Apple Watch Ultra is certified to WR100. Apple Watch Ultra is also certified to EN 13319, which is an internationally recognized standard for dive accessories, including depth gauges that are relied upon by recreational divers around the world.

Utilizing a new depth gauge, Apple Watch Ultra features a Depth app designed with an intuitive user interface. With just a glance, the Depth app displays time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and max depth reached. Users can program the Action button to instantly launch the Depth app.

In partnership with Huish Outdoors, known for delivering innovative and reliable equipment for recreational diving, the new Oceanic+ app turns Apple Watch Ultra into a capable dive computer. Available from the App Store later this fall, the app runs the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, and includes dive planning, easy-to-read dive metrics, visual and haptic alerts, no-decompression limit, ascent rate, and safety stop guidance. Oceanic+ also offers a personalized user profile, reports on current and local dive conditions, and a dive logbook that can be shared with family and friends and automatically syncs to iPhone.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Apple to combine our world-renowned expertise in scuba with the unique capability of Apple Watch Ultra to turn the same everyday watch into an innovative dive computer,” said Mike Huish, CEO of Huish Outdoors. “With Oceanic+, Apple Watch Ultra users can enjoy a new and enriched experience during scuba activities.”",tumamaesmuycaliente,13,0,2022-09-07 17:55:28,Apple Watch

"If I made Dive computers I would be a little concerned. This is the first model of this watch.

Who knows down the line with future iterations how many improvements etc down the line. Future ability to connect to tanks, extra depth capability etc…

"Surprised at the announcement, but should sell really well:

- Garmin has already proven there is a market and way to make a smartwatch dive computer; Shearwater was a direct competitor, differentiated by the advanced tech diving functions

- Recreational market vastly outsizes the tech market, even though our view here is skewed. Massive target market.

- Meets the appropriate standards for dive computer safety

- Offers features missing on a lot of midrange dive computers (e.g. color backlit screen instead of grayscale LCD) while also offering compelling Apple ecosystem benefits

- I expect additional features (e.g. nitrox) will be added later if not already present. Really just a software update.

Won't satisfy more advanced diving needs because it either doesn't make sense to include (e.g. trimix and >40m depth) or isn't suitable for other types of diving (e.g. rechargeable battery won't be considered by a portion of the community), but it'll sell really well.",golfzerodelta,22,0,2022-09-07 17:50:31,Apple Watch

"I think this is mainly marketing for Apple. It is modern take on the classic dive watch. Take a look at the Rolex Submariner, or any classic dive watch, web page and compare to the dive section of Apple watch promo site. 

I am sure that Apple did their homework and has made hardware for a perfectly usable rec dive computer. But as many other said this is for the occasional diver to flash and show off their latest tech gadget on a dive boat. The non diver, who will see scuba as an extreme environment, will get the marketing message that if it is good enough for scuba it is good enough for their backyard pool.

Edit: I didn't mean that the apple watch is targeting people who would want to buy a classic dive watch. But they are marketing a life style in the same way a Rolex markets a lifestyle. Apples pitch is for the tech centric active outdoors lifestyle.",chiefbubblemaker,21,0,2022-09-08 04:03:08,Apple Watch
"I'd like to bring up a point that I haven't seen made yet.... There's already apps that allow phones (in waterproof cases) to communicate underwater via sonar using the built-in speaker and microphone. [https://underwatermessaging.cs.washington.edu/](https://underwatermessaging.cs.washington.edu/)  


So, what's stopping Apple (or Oceanic?) from adding air integration further down the line? The hardware required is already in the watch. They'd just need to use Bluetooth on the surface, and sonar while diving. I think that Garmin is already doing that for the descent, right? It would also allow for diver-to-diver communication. Which is a feature I've seen some manufactures toying with.

&#x200B;

So, beyond the worries about battery life, if this thing can become capable of air integration, it could become a bigger threat to recreational dive computer manufacturers than we realize. If the transmitter was about the same price as Shearwater's (\~$400), that would make for a very price competitive option.",zinszins,18,0,2022-09-07 21:01:56,Apple Watch
"Considering the price tag, the need for an additional (possibly paid) app to run full computer mode, and Apple's history of planned obsolescence, I definitely can't see this replacing any sort of dedicated dive computer for the serious diver.

"I will admit this is a feature that I wanted that I thought I would never see on Apple watch. It is pretty great, wrist dive computers are convenient, I always use one as a back up to my main computer so this works out perfectly. We can criticize the features and execution, but a good wrist computer is usually almost 2x the cost of this and is used for one thing. I rarely wear my Shearwater to the office. I applaud Apple for creating the feature for a small number of people.",EIGHTHOLE,16,0,2022-09-08 15:14:31,Apple Watch
"When you look around, 99% of divers use very basic models. The computers are huge, clunky, have limited functions and the technology hasn’t changed for 20 years. Worst of all, you need to change the battery every now and then. For people who don’t need a Shearwater, who aren’t into tech diving and who are looking for basic features, this is perfect. Since I already have an Apple Watch and a relatively new dive computer, I probably won’t make the investment. I do appreciate though that these functions now exist for Apple Watches.",thegerams,33,0,2022-09-08 04:26:18,Apple Watch
"why are so many people in this thread so fucking salty?

I'm getting certifieid this month and was doing window-shopping at dive computers (probably something i wont own for a while after cert since i can rent, but it was fun to look and do research).

As a completely casual diver who will only be diving 2-3 times a year, this seems like an awesome value-add to consumers like me.

I'm not even in the apple ecosystem (i use macbook, but android phone, android earbuds, was planning to get android watch).

As long as it's a safe an reliable hardware + algo (which i assume it will be since they dont wanna get their faces sued off if someone gets hurt using it) i don't see why i wouldn't want something like this.

So many people are saying ""this is just a gimmick"" but to me this looks like genuine added value that brings us towards the future. I'd rather spend 800 on an apple watch that I can use as a casual OW diver than ~300 on an entry level dive computer because the apple watch provides me a lot more use. And as samsung and google start to compete and add a depth sensor, the price for this feature will come down.

For serious divers, they will *always* want a dedicated piece of hardware that will withstand every situation, but for a casual recreational diver that is just getting certified so i can dive during vacations, this seems like an great feature.",TrashQuestion,85,0,2022-09-07 20:44:28,Apple Watch

"Im currently using an older model of the watch. 
While I’m missing a few features (air integration, trimix, multiple tanks, max working pressure) it could make for a nice back up on rec dives.


What will be interesting to see is what happens when the max. depth of the sensor is exceeded- the watch is rated to more than double the depth of the sensor.

One big advantage i can see is the ability to be located on the surface if lost (as long as there’s cell reception).",frohstr,12,0,2022-09-07 20:00:56,Apple Watch
"I was sold until they dropped that little tidbit about the oceanic+ app costing $80 a year. Sure the $ 800 price tag for the watch would be reasonable for a everyday watch you can wear diving; however, even the occasional diver would eventually pay more than even a high end computer because every time you use it the price goes up. So after 6 years you could have bought an air integrated dive computer. Even that estimation is reliant on oceanic to not make changes to their pricing model. 

If it was a one time payment it would likely still be worth it but I don’t appreciate the money drain they’ve set up. As someone else mentioned, other apps might come about that have a better pricing model but we will have to wait and see.",MomoMac,4,0,2022-09-08 18:36:57,Apple Watch

"Not an expert in SCUBA tech by any means, but this is the type of innovation that's going to force SCUBA oriented R&D to innovate more quickly if they want to remain relevant. I've already seen it mentioned earlier, but the adoption rate could potentially ""skyrocket"" as a result of users wanting to carry less sophisticated hardware, and sourcing hardware from a well known reputable mfg. Not saying I don't trust SCUBA mfgs to produce reliable products (because by and large they do), but here you have a giant in the tech industry and one of the worlds wealthiest companies that can cherry pick virtually any industry they want to disrupt at any given point in time. Great example to look at is Garmin/TomTom navigation. Nobody buys dedicated GPS units en masse anymore because it's available on our phones. Provided this feature asserts itself as being reliable; even if it's used as a backup to a primary watch on deeper/longer dives, it may solidify itself as the primary for the casual rec diver as an every day wear. And if it doesn't support nitrox or advanced features, I don't fathom it couldn't be engineered too in software/firmware updates and future models. It may even force the rest of the industry to standardize tech to remain relevant.

They are spec'd to withstand the pressure, but as the majority of the users are not expected to actually use it this way, one or more minor component will give out, and the device will fail.

“The touch screen is not functioning while I’m at the surface” 
“My crown is frozen after a dive”
“My Apple Watch ultra flooded, now what?”

There’s probably about 100 FAQs on the page all related to it. 

Also note that you will not be able to use the touch screen while diving. It will rely on buttons and the crown only. When it touches water, it “immediately enters water lock mode which disables the touch screen”

I'm also a scuba diver.

I’ll be running with both watches but I am hopeful that the Apple Watch can replace my Garmin going forward.

"The battery life is my main reason.  I’m a fitness nut.  In addition to circuit training, I like hiking and running outside a lot.  I’ve tried using a Sunnto as my daily driver, but it lacked the smartwatch capabilities that my Apple Watch has.

Given that I’m fully embedded into the Apple ecosystem, I prefer to use an Apple product due to the seamless integration with my other Apple products.

I love my series 4 but the battery barely lasts a day.  I also want to take advantage of sleep data but I don’t want to have to take my watch off to charge multiple times a day to get the data.

I told myself, I would only upgrade my watch from the series 4 if they could increase the battery life to 24 hours with regular usage…and here we are.   I’m a bit concerned about the size of the watch, but it’s not a deal breaker.",Selinakvle,2,0,2022-09-20 17:46:47,Apple Watch

"I resolved to upgrade my Series 4 this year, before any announcement and I wasn’t following too closely on a “pro” or “ultra” model before anything was dropped so I was pretty captivated by it when I wanted the event.

Reasons for upgrading the Series 4: Battery life, AOD, fast charging.  I almost picked up a 7 last year but held out.

I am fairly outdoorsy, nothing on the extreme end of things but I def get out quite a bit and there have been numerous times in the past 4 years I would have benefited from some of the ultra features.  Multiple 10-18 mile day hikes, MTB cycling, kayaking and a couple over night backpacking trips.  I’ve also recently got into ADV riding so the SOS features on the phone and watch are compelling (this past year on a week long trip a person in our party had the InReach, so this fills that niche without me having to get another device).

I do a lot of activity tracking in the snow season with snowboarding using Slopes, so battery life and extra features may be beneficial there, but I go straight from 2 hours of snowboarding into an 8 hour active shift at work where I track more exercise for HIIT, 2-3 miles of trail runs, etc.  I’ve absorbed a lot of features the 4 offers and expect I’ll slowly do the same with the extra features from the Ultra.

So, was this watch made for me in regards to extreme sports?  No.  Was it worth the extra scratch since I intended to spend $400 on the 8?  Yes, I think so.  But if it doesn’t or the watch is too bulky I’ll send it back and go to an 8.  I think it will stay around though.

Reasons for not wanting the Ultra: Bulk, and being “that guy”.  The watch sends a statement.  I already regret getting the orange watch band, but I was clicking through the order screen so fast I didn’t want to delay the shipment by browsing around…. I’ll probably stick with my Nomad Sport strap or post for a band swap if anyone else is interested in the orange (it’s clashes strong with what I wear for work I need something more muted.)",-ShootMeNow-,1,0,2022-09-19 18:57:00,Apple Watch
"I’m not buying it. Having had several of the standard issue watches, they’ve proven durable enough for my needs but also can be worn with casual or dress clothes and look decent to good. This watch is too big for my preferences. 

I can make battery life work for me. And with the latest watchOS update, the battery life can really be stretched so I hear. I’ve not updated yet.

If you want it buy it, it’s all about what works for you.",jaybo41,1,0,2022-09-19 19:00:46,Apple Watch
"I can’t decide. I want it first and foremost because “new and shiny.” I buy a new iPhone every year, but the watch I typically keep in three year cycles, owning a S0, S3 and currently an S6. I could probably justify it by wanting significantly improved battery life, as one of my jobs I work 24 hour shifts. My S6 CAN make it, but only barely and is running on fumes at the end. The extra cushion would be nice. I also am interested in the increased durability, as both of my jobs are physically demanding with high potential for a damaged watch. But, with that said, I’ve yet to damage an Apple Watch during daily, caseless and careless wear and I’ve worn an Apple Watch every day since the the S0 launched. So I don’t think I’ll get it this year, but it might be my pick for my 3 year upgrade next year.",kelter20,1,0,2022-09-19 19:02:12,Apple Watch

But, could you have worn the watch too tight? Got to at least fit 2 fingers under the strap. All the way through for it not to be tight. 

I noticed this with my ring. So, we got cheaper ones for me to wear when I was getting fatter. (I’m losing weight now tho) I went up from a size 10, to a size 13 ring. Now back down to an 11. Also, noticed that I can tighten my watch up a bit more. From 2 to 3. To nearly 4! With some wiggle room on 4. So staying on 3. 

In order for indentation to not happen, anywhere on your body, you need to have it loosely fit.

So, at the end of the day, it’s up to you on what you do and wear. How tight or loose the watch fitting is.

There seems to be no major difference between the S6 and S8 for sleep tracking, so I'm happy with my decision and have saved ~£250.",g9icy,1,0,2022-09-15 22:14:00,Apple Watch

Less than an hour later I was in the ER with my heart rate climbing over 180bpm, and I was in septic shock from an infection I was completely unaware of. Chances are that I would’ve died.

So did my watch save my life? No, because my friend would’ve made me go either way. But it DID help me realize that I needed help and not more sleep.",Isturma,28,0,2023-02-20 12:11:48,Apple Watch

As far as I can tell, what I'd be missing out on with the SE would be a larger screen, SpO2 and ECG, and always-on display, mainly. I turned off SpO2 on my Garmin because I found that I simply never looked at it, but is it more useful in Apple Health? Is the bigger screen worth it?

"So I used to work in an Apple store back when this watch came out and can speak a little bit to this. Clearly I am not the person who bought it, but the process was very strict at the time. Only “Experts” or management was allowed to provide the support to those who came in looking to purchase the watch. The company really wanted to give these individuals a bit more attention when it came to purchasing these watches (for obvious reasons). 

There was a whole room or section of the store dedicated to this and people would come in and try on the watches before the order was placed for the watch. I think the watch was only allowed to be delivered to the store but I’m not quite sure if this detail. 

On a side note, I did have a customer come in once with a watch that wasn’t working at the time to get it fixed. I told the owner that it would take about 20-30 minutes to solve the problem and he told me to wipe it clean bc it wasn’t worth his time to sit there and wait. As I’m wiping the watch clean he gets up, walks out of the store and comes back 10 minutes later wearing a brand new Cartier watch that was worth 10-15k at the time. Told me that 30 minutes plus the time it took him to come in wasn’t worth the trouble of the Apple Watch and that he was going to give the watch to his assistant.",the_sammich_man,69,0,2023-08-23 13:39:19,Apple Watch

Full Text: 

An Apple Watch Series 7 user is speaking out after their device overheated, started smoking, and eventually exploded. The case was brought to Apple’s attention and the company confirmed it would investigate what happened. At the same time, however, Apple also attempted to coerce the user into staying silent and not sharing the story.  
In a conversation with 9to5Mac, this Apple Watch user explained that he was wearing it when he noticed that it was getting much hotter than usual. He then found that the back of the Apple Watch had cracked and watchOS was showing a warning about needing to shut down due to its temperature. For further context, this user was in their house where the temperature was just over 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  
After this, the Apple Watch user said that he immediately called Apple Support to explain the situation. The call was escalated through multiple levels of Apple’s support hierarchy, ultimately landing in the hands of a manager who created a case for further investigation. There was no solution or advice provided after this call, just instructions to not touch the watch until he heard back from the company.  
The following morning, however, the situation escalated even further. The Apple Watch user woke up to find the Apple Watch even hotter to the touch and the heat had shattered the device’s display.  
When the user picked up the Apple Watch to take pictures to send to Apple, it started to immediately make “crackling sounds.” It then “exploded” just as he was throwing it out the window. The watch left burn marks on the user’s couch. He also ended up visiting the emergency room because of lead poisoning concerns, but it’s important to remember the Apple Watch does not actually contain nearly enough lead to actually cause poisoning. He was simply concerned about it.  
He then reached out to Apple again to give an update on the situation. He was told that the case would be a “top priority” and he would receive an update by the following Monday. It wasn’t until today, however, that he heard back from Apple.  
The company arranged a delivery pickup and said that it is taking the Apple Watch to its labs for further testing. Apple also sent him a document, asking him to sign it and agree not to share this story with anyone. He declined to sign the document, and instead reached out to 9to5Mac to tell the story.",m3antar,411,0,2022-10-06 09:34:51,Apple Watch

"I’m dubious. If the watch overheats on his wrist enough to crack the back glass on day one, that battery isn’t going to have enough zot left in it to fully explode the next day.

"One of the reasons I'd never wear a smartwatch is that I don't wish to be bothered by beeps and buzzes all damn day reminding me of unimportant things. I'll do that in my own time. ""You can turn it off,"" say people. And I agree; by not buying into that madness. I save $500 by not buying into that bullshit that needs to be replaced every few years.

The second reason is this. What if the battery starts to overheat, expand, and the strap gets tighter and tighter? You can't take it off. It heats up. Boom.

I suppose the settlement would be fascinating for many.

Which makes me wonder why this news got out. Usually, companies are very good at rushing lawyers into these cases. Sign the agreement; here's a settlement; sign both to receive your money.

And you'll be $1M richer. And not soon after, you'll realize you could've gotten so much more out of this if *you lawyered up* and didn't fall for their bullying strategy.",mahade,1,0,2022-10-06 19:12:48,Apple Watch

But, the potential life savings of the automatic calls massively outweighs the modicum of extra staffing costs. 

When I crashed my motorcycle, the next thing I recall in my helmet Bluetooth was, “City 911, What is your emergency?”
