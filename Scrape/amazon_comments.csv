    Great quality but expensive
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023,"







  
  
    The phone looks exactly as it it has just come out of the factory, perfect in every way. With hindsight though almost £100 for a six year old phone seems a bit much, in particular as it will not be able to use the newer IOS.

    The sweet spot in the current lineup
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2023,"







  
  
    Finally rid of the notch and lightning connection. The reason I purchased this.Nicely boxed with tamper sealingComplete with a Braided usb-c lead accessory which is cool.Has the usual sim pin included in the UK.I wish the telecoms market would get their act together on eSIM.Colour, I had intended to get boring black but I chose a pastel Matt Green with the glossy apple logo to the rear. Chosen more due to the fact that the other colours had sold out but I actually like it now I’ve got it and its colour is concealed in my OtterBox Strada case anyway.On opening, the first thing you will notice is how lightweight the phone is and in my position only weighed down by the case weight.You will notice the dual cameras are very pronounced and the phone doesn’t lay flat on a surface.My case offers excellent protection for the lenses and allows it to lay flush.The iPhone has an aluminium casing with lovely rounded edges.Set up for my experience. This was the painful part.Transferring data from my iPhone 11 was not the easiest of tasks and I had to take an update to the fifteen before it would initiate the transfer process.However Once completed my new phone was near identical in appearance and usability apart from one or two apps that required setting up again.The Home Screen is large, bright and colourful is blessed with something called the Dynamic island which alters its size and shape dependent on the app that requires it.This is a great feature introduced to recent Apple phones and transforms the viewing experience when watching content playback of the likes  of Prime, Netflix, Disney etc.It is finally a really enjoyable viewing experience now the dreaded notch has gone.Some have mentioned a lower refresh rate on this model compared to the Pro models but is not a noticeable problem for me.Not just watching but the Sound quality even at low volumes is brilliant particularly when watching movies.Watch Blade Runner 2049 or rather listen to it on the Apple app is a totally immersive experience even without AirPods.Officer K’s visit to the Wallace Corporation’s Earth Headquarters has great depth and echo as he exchanges dialogue with the file clerk and Luv in its large halls.iOS 17 standby mode is slightly disappointing down to the exclusivity of the pro models only having an always on display. But this is the only real disappointment of this model.The ability to plug in USB devices and exchange data or charge or receive power from other devices is a real step forward.Battery life is phenomenal. End of!Doesn’t get hot when charging and lasts ages. Unless you have got it glued to your face you can expect a couple of days between charges for average use and when the battery is new of course.I have some older wireless chargers that are struggling a bit to charge through the mag safe case with the phone attached.This hasn’t been an issue before with my other phones. I haven’t got a new type mag safe charger yet and is not really a phone issueThe camera has several new features including automatically picking out portraits without specifically switching to portrait mode.It has a up to 48 mega pixel camera and with iOS 17 can produce bokeh effect portraits.There are some brilliant video modes including a live action sports type mode.4K or HD recording and frame rate adjustment.

    It comes with no charger, but with charging cable.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023,"







  
  
    Received the iPhone 15 plus for a friend of mine only to find that apple have been stingy and not provided a charging plug but they supply the cable. It’s ironic that if you buy an iPad from apple you will get a charging plug but not for the iPhone which costs twice as much as an iPad. Obviously I have had to order a charging plug separately but legally apple are selling something that technically is not fit for purpose because if you don’t have any means of charging the iPhone then it’s practically no good to you. Secondly there was no mention of what is supplied with the iPhone so it could be classed as mis-selling. Is this apple trying to be revengeful against the EU who forced them to have a usb-c socket instead of an eight pin blade on their iPads and iPhones. I expect so!

",Reviewed in Germany on 27 September 2023,"







  
    Wie jedes Jahr wollte ich mir nicht das neue iPhone kaufen und habs mir – wie jedes Jahr – doch gekauft.🤣🥳Dieses Mal wurde es die gelbe Plus Version. Ich hatte vorher das 14 plus.Allein von der Kamera her lohnt sich der Umstieg. Das 15+ macht Fotos wie früher nur die Pro Modelle. für mich als Wenigfotografierer lohnt sich ein Pro nicht.Das Plus hat gegenüber den normalen 15ern aber auch schon mehr Akkulaufzeit.Was für mich weiterhin Sinn macht, ist der USB C Anschluss, da ich im Besitz eines iPad Pro bin und auch im Besitz eines MacBook, so dass ich jetzt alles mit dem gleichen Kabel laden kann.Die Rückseite ist etwas matter und der Apfel nicht mehr silber auf der Rückseite. Das ist das einzige, was mir nicht so gut gefällt optisch. Aber das ist jammernnauf hohem Niveau.Von mir natürlich klare Kaufempfehlung 🤣🥳Kleiner Wermutstropfen an dem ganzen System. Update ist, dass bei der Apple Watch die Batterieanzeige und das anpingen vom unteren Bildschirmrand nicht mehr geht. Aber das hat mit dem Handy an sich nichts zu tun.

    I purchased this phone for my Mum, and spent ages reading the reviews, which were both good and bad.  I received it this morning and couldn't be happier with it.  There is a tiny scratch on the screen and a couple of very fine airline scratches on back, but that is it.  I was not impressed with the cable that came with it, when I removed it from my plug the cover of the usb came off in my hands, so threw that straight in the bin and I ordered a set of 2 x fast charging plugs with the cables.  I bought a lovely clear case with rose gold edging to finish it off.  I have never purchased refurbished tech before but would definitely recommend, in my case I have been able to upgrade my Mum's phone for a lot less.

    Great value for money, works perfectly, looks brand new no scratches on screen or case. One tiny downside, battery is at 87%. But seeing as the iPhone 12 has been out for a few years, it’s understandable. Didn’t come in original box but the listing clearly states that it may not. All in all? Good for a few years, still getting updates and at a fraction of the cost of a new one. Why pay more if you don’t have to?

As app are basically the same .Only best features is that it has 5G and battery life is a small bit longer  the camera .Also since they got rid of earphones and plug. They could have included a cover to protect the cameraSo you get less for money than before

    My wife and I have had IPhones for years but as normal with Apple prices are getting out of hand! We moved away from contracts 5 years ago so buy them outright.We had 11 so the move to 14 was a big jump. The better half is pleased and says it does what’s she wants.Gone are the days when we want the latest model. If you change just before the new model is released often it’s on a discount and was on 5 months interest free! Not much difference with Apple year to year as they want you to change as often as possible.We won’t change now till 18 so another 3 years sorted.

    Brilliant refurbished phone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    Just over £200 for a refurbished iPhone 12 mini. Absolute bargain. The condition of it is like brand-new there’s not a mark anywhere on it as you can see in the pictures. I’ve had an iPhone 15 which got sent back because this one does everything that that one does for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 has a slightly better camera and better speakers for listening to music but to me it wasn’t worth an extra £500 on top of the price of this. I was worried about the size, but the size is perfect. It’s such a good quality screen that you forget how small this phone is and I’m surprised by how quick I can type on the keyboard is very clever. I’m very intuitive and very responsive. And the appearance is so cool, I love the blue as well which is an added bonus on top of everything else and the price. I think I found a new way to find future phones. Definitely recommended.

    Great phone, appalling battery life
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2023,"







  
  
    I love the size of this phone and coming from an iPhone SE, this feels a world away from my previous in terms of features and functionality. The screen also feels much bigger because of the small bezel. Cameras are great, face ID is very quick - I hardly notice it, as by the time I've picked up my phone it will have unlocked already. The battery is truly terrible unfortunately and you can see it draining away under your eyes even with light use. I have ended up having to charge it constantly as it will never make it to the end of the day. Although the battery is at 100% life, I suspect this might be a third-party battery that isn't as good as the original. Either that, or the battery really just is utter cr*p. The screen, camera lens and the back of the phone look absolutely spotless, however there are a few quite obvious chips around the lens cutout and around the charging slot, a bit cheeky to sell as 'excellent quality'. There was also quite a bit of grime/dirt around the screen, which seems weird for a refurbished phone. They could have easily cleaned it a bit better. Other than that this was great value for money.

    NOT WORTH It -  my experience
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2023,"







  
  
    I bought a used IPhone 12 mini in EXCELLENT condition, hoping that the phone will be damage free and with good battery health .I spent 379 for the phone .The phone was nicely packed , the phone had visible marks , the battery health was around 83% which is not good for such an expensive phone , if the batteries health is just above 80% , one would require a new battery in the next 12.months ( so a battery expenditure after 12 months ) which is not worth it . The most important component in an iPhone is the battery which requires replacing earlier than other components.As soon as I put the phone for charging, the phone got hot in 20 minutes which is a sign of a phone requiring repairs in the next few months . I requested for a refund within 45 minutes of receiving the phone .In refurbished phones , the water protection is also compromised. The life of speakers and mic is also reduced which is another potential cost in the future. I am a user of iPhones and had to replace speaker and mic after 5 years .In my opinion it is lnot worth buying a refurbished phone unless you are ready to take a risk , and at what cost . If you are going for a cheap phone then one can take a risk , however not for an expensive iPhone . I finally decided to buy a new phone with peace of mind for the next few years.I returned the phone , I got my money after 2 weeks ( as per the process )I even requested the seller to replace my phone with an excellent condition phone , however they had none in stock .

    I bought this on EMI payments as my old iPhone 5S recently packed up whilst I was involved in the purchase of a house. I needed to spread the cost but also have the full facility of a phone without having to negotiate credit cards, which I didn't want to get into, or pay massive upfront costs. For sixty quid a month (plus my tiny GiffGaff sim) I have a new phone, which will be all paid in a year. I also got 2T of iCould storage and an external generic hard drive for my old Mac around the same time for about 25 quid. This meant I could 'start again' with my Mac, and the endless photos from my travels could be stored safely while I save up for a new Macbook. Meanwhile, this phone has double the storage of my old Macbook. Unlike my old phone, it can perform admin tasks when I'm in quiet moments at work, such as applying for jobs. I'm not meaning to explain phones, it's just that for me new tech isn't renewed that often and I had to justify the expense to myself. This phone has already proved itself over the last month. The camera is much better than my old phone, but not quite as flashy as the most recent iPhone. I couldn't justify an extra 300 quid for a camera, regardless of my professional art needs, that wouldn't really meet my landscape photography needs. You still can't fit a mirror inside an iPhone in order to make it perform as well as an SLR. it's jus tnot physically possible yet to lose that terrible over-size foreground emphasis you get inmost smartphone pics. But for reference photos, portrait photography with friends, and general snaps this camera is good. I have an SLR I will use for landscapes instead, and may upgrade. The joy of a new phone is being able to listen to all the music you couldn't store on the old one, being able to perform complex functions a less powerful phone can't deal with, and also being able to indulge all your interests/needs in one place without worrying about space. I prioritised my phone upgrade before my Macbook upgrade for precisely this reason. If you have to choose between which one to upgrade, I'd go with the phone as you can always get cables to link your phone to a projector or tv screen if you're a student or trying to cut costs in the current economy. I'm amazed at how much I can watch on my unlimited data plan - the only risk is becoming a bit of an internet-addict too quickly. I love a new app called Metronaut too, so useful for musicians, and it's a relief to be able to indule my passions wihtout fear of freeze or collapse. Whenever I have had problems with this, it just requires a switch-off/switch-on - it's usually as I've had too much activity on my phone (for like, hours) or I just haven't closed pages. I""m impressed with the low-light picture-taking too - I can instantly update photos to Insta even in difficult light conditions. It means a better-documented moment-to-moment sense of of the World, and memories get stored, isntead of lost in storage collapse and frustration.

    A step ahead of the game.

    Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

    The phone works well and looks fabulous.It was superbly packaged and arrived on time without a blemish on the phone or the box.  However, I couldn't transfer all my old phone's data over to it until I had performed a ""factory reset"" on the new phone, leading me to believe that it was maybe not completely brand new!I may be wrong, as I say it was without blemish when it landed, but I would have thought that a completely new and unused phone shouldn't require a reset before use! Otherwise, very happy.

    Fingers crossed so far so good. After smashing my new phone at beginning of contract and having no insurance (stupid I know) I needed another I phone quick and not too expensive. Having researched I decided to go with a refurb from Amazon as I liked it is guaranteed for 12 months. The condition was excellent and looked brand new, it was all ready to just put my SIM card in and so far has worked great. I’m really happy and wouldn’t have an issue buying a refurb again.

    Phone is from Apple, and is great. Because it's apple .But..Used one here comes with a knockoff charger, that should go in the garbage straight away - if you value your life. It also came with USB-A to USB-C cable, which with this phone is useless. So if you don't have any iPhones - good luck and order a cable separately. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    My phone has clearly been used by someone not English and hasn’t been completely ‘cleaned’ On WhatsApp the key for emojiwas a world icon and simply changed from 2 languages one English and one I didn’t recognise. There was no instructions how to rectify this and I had to use trial and error before I worked out how to rid it of the second language and restore the emoji symbol.  On my calendar there is an entrant in German. I don’t know how many more examples of the lack of cleaning the phone I am going to find and am worried about this phone now - I have bank details etc and wonder if this phone is even safe

    My i=phone 7 broke so I bought a cheap android phone which turned out to be a waste of money so rather reluctantly decided to go for this renewed i=phone SE. Delivery was. fast and efficient (DPD) and was wellpackaged. The phone is in immaculate condition and looks like new. After updating it with Apples latestupdates it was easy to add apps that I required and within 30 minutes of receipt was working superbly.I need not have worried about buying this phone and would highly recommend both the phone and the supplier. I am a very happy customer.

    Maine Coon Kitten destroyed iPhone X
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2023,"







  
  
    Kitten or the “culprit” now set as new screen saver on this iPhone SE 2020 64GB, destroyed my iPhone X to a near unworkable condition. I couldn’t afford to go out and spend £750 - £1,000 + on a new phone, so took a bit of a chance and went for refurbished SE.This cost a much more affordable £119.Condition was graded as “C” on box, but to me it looks like a new phone! No dents, no scratches and clean as a whistle.Delivery was special delivery 24hrs, so received phone almost instantly! Really top points for delivery! Exceptional.Battery is at 96% health as seen in pics.My only real issue that has caused me a headache is the 64GB storage, not enough to take on the iPhone X, and because my phone was so badly damaged I couldn’t remove things to get that memory down.However, I did it a different way, time consuming but has worked out pretty okay. My iPad is pretty much a clone of my phone, so did a full iCloud backup of iPad, had to increase iCloud storage so that’s now £2.99 a month. But I was already paying for 50GB, so in reality it’s an extra cost of £2 a month.Then I asked the iPhone SE to restore from iCloud, because all the photos are compressed this is now taking up 40GB on the iPhone SE. if you need a picture in full HD resolution you just click the cloud button and it will retrieve it for you.Also offloaded apps unlikely to be used on phone, makes them a couple of MB but all the data is saved in the cloud, so at any point you can pull it back. So this has been a solution.It ported in the apps, the passwords, I configured email so that’s all there, messenger was just a log in and its put all that on there. Whatsapp was a case of logging in and thats all gone on, the only thing it hasn’t gone on is contacts. Going to try and find a way to do this later on. If I have to do manually it will be a bit of an ache as about 400+ names and numbers to add!It did want an update to OS 16.6, not a problem, 30 min job.Not put sim in just yet, getting the whole thing fully set up first on Wi-Fi, sim will be last to go in at the end of today.Of course, you can spend more money and get 256GB phone and it will just clone itself. But that’s going to be £££ more.This way I should be up and running by end of the day for £119 - express delivery and to my eye a phone that looks new, with excellent condition battery. Plus I’ve ordered an extra tough case for it, so the “culprit” can’t do a repeat performance, so even if there were some fine scratches / signs of wear, they would be covered by casing anyway.So far so good, will be relived when sim is in, that’s the final step to make and receive calls.Highly recommend, just be mindful that 64GB is quite low storage these days, but as explained above, there is a way around that.A cost effective solution to a desperate situation that needed an emergency replacement. I’m also lead to believe “Wikipedia” that the A13 chip in the SE 2020 is an improvement on the X.Also, this is the fastest item I’ve ever had delivered bar a takeaway, and I live in the Channel Islands. Well impressed with delivery! Impressed with condition of phone “like new” and impressed at that great battery health.I was so distressed after the kitten pulled apart my iPhone X, and worried about replacement costs. I’m so relieved this option existed and hasn’t broke the bank.Think I’m converted to going down the refurbished route in the future, the savings are huge!Many thanks to the seller! 5******

    Ottimo prodotto!!! 😊📱
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 6 July 2023,"







  
    L'iPhone SE 2020 credo che ad oggi sia ancora un gran bel dispositivo , dall'ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo (prodotto ricondizionato arrivato in eccellenti condizioni), che permette di accedere al ""costoso"" mondo Apple senza svenarsi. Ha l'iconico form factor che è stato introdotto con l'iphone 6 (con qualche  miglioria davvero degna di nota in termini di materiali); pertanto, lo smartphone è molto compatto, facilmente utilizzabile con una mano, potente e alla portata di tutti. È quindi perfetto per chi è alla ricerca di uno smartphone che sia allo stesso tempo di alta qualità e pratico. Ha un display Retina HD da 4,7 pollici ed il pratico lettore di impronte digitale. Ottima fotocamera da 12 megapixel che beneficia anche dell'elaborazione delle foto del potente chip A13 (in pratica foto migliori rispetto alle precedenti generazioni); buona fotocamera frontale da 7 megapixel. Come detto, il chip integrato nel telefono è il potente A13 Bionic  che consente di giocare senza problemi ai giochi più recenti, navigare in Internet o guardare film e serie TV in modo fluido e piacevole (equipaggiato con tre giga di ram).  Inoltre, grazie al Neural Engine, l'iPhone SE 2020 è in grado di eseguire compiti che richiedono l'uso dell'intelligenza artificiale, come la classificazione automatica delle foto sul telefono in base al soggetto; presenti, ovviamente, tutti i sensori ""moderni"" (barometro, accellerometro, giroscopio, nfc, ecc). Per quanto riguarda la batteria, con un utilizzo medio, la giornata si fa senza particolari problemi (presente, inoltre, la ricarica wireless). La connettività è la LTE (non presente il jack da 3,5 per le cuffie). Insomma, a mio avviso l'unica cosa da valutare è se rispetto alle proprie esigenze può andar bene il form factor ""old style"" (secondo me sempre bello)  e lo schermo da 4,7 pollici; se tali aspetti non costituiscono un problema, l'acquisto è sicuramente consigliato sia come telefono principale o, in alternativa, come secondo telefono. Valutando poi che, ad oggi, un ricondizionato in condizioni pari al nuovo può essere acquistato ad un prezzo concorrenziale, direi cinque stelle. Spero di essere stato utile 👋🏼

Quand j'ai reçu le produit, il était en excellent état, bien nettoyer et aucune fissure. Les accessoires marchaient très bien même si ce ne sont pas ceux d'origine. La batterie est performante, mais pour moi elle n'est pas assez suffisante, ça se décharge un peu vite, mais je peux comprendre vu que se n'est pas du neuf. L'outil de retrait de la carte SIM, le chargeur et le câble de chargement étais bien inclus, dommage que les écouteurs n'étaient pas livrés avec.Les qualités :- La qualité photo pour le prix est parfait.- L'écran- La Taille- La Performence- La DurabilitéLes défauts :- La Batterie- La Mémoire- Le StockageJ'ai été très surpris en voyant que le produit répondait à mes attentes même plus. L'appareil possède de nombreuses fonctionnalités très performante. De plus, il a été livré rapidement.Je recommande cet iPhone SE 2e Génération reconditionné pour ceux qui veulent économiser de l'argent tout en faisant de bonnes affaires avec un téléphone performant.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2023,"







  
  
    I had an issue with the battery not holding its charge or even able to tell me what percentage it had left accurately. Also the screen didn’t feel as responsive as I know an apple phone usually is which could be linked to the battery, I am not sure. I did have to pay for returning however it seems they have reimbursed me for that which I am very happy about and I really do appreciate it which is why I’m giving them a better rating. They processed my return the same day they received it which was noticed.

    Great phone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2022,"







  
  
    The phone arrived the next day and upon first inspection the condition of the phone was great and looked brand new. There is very slight wear and tear on the corners but they’re not noticeable. My phone did not come in an original IPhone box which did not bother me but may disappoint others, especially if they’re giving it as a gift. The charger I received was not an original apple one and it certainly is not as powerful.I’m a little disappointed in the battery health which is 86% but I guess it’s a risk you take when buying one of these. The screen has also been replaced upon further inspection but it feels every bit as good as an original IPhone one.Overall, for the price I’m happy with my phone and as long as the phone lasts for a year or two, I’ll happily purchase from here again.

    Great Value not so Great Battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020,"







  
  
    I got the product and it was in perfect condition. No scratches or anything on the body which did really surprise me. The only problem was that the battery health was at 83% but for what is basically a half price phone, even in October 2020, this isn’t too much of an issue. It’s still worth it even if I have to replace the battery. Would recommend if you want a top phone on a smaller budget.  Face Recognition is insanely fast i was very surprised as i’m used to the touch ID on older apple phones. However for anyone using this for apple pay, it doesn’t work with a mask on so you’ll have to type your passcode.  OLED screen is fantastic and I would say it’s the best feature of the phone. However for those who aren’t too bothered by this you may not really notice too much difference from the LCD screens on the lower market iPhones.  Doesn’t come in Original packaging and doesn’t come with the earphones for anyone wondering. It did include a charging brick and charging cable.  I personally love the 3D touch on this phone that they removed on the iPhone 11 range if that’s something that you enjoy.  I was slightly worried when i ordered it but that it would come and not be in a good condition. However after using this for a few days i can confirm that this is an all round good buy and would recommend. Would have given 5 stars if the batter health was above 95%.

    bought it six months ago and immediately the battery wasn't healthy and began to deteriorate very quickly and in the end would just switch off. arranged to send it back to the seller and when he received it he said that due to the phone being damaged by me, he would not fix it - I had not damaged the phone and the phone was fine when I sent it.The seller was very unhelpful to the point I had to ask Amazon to step in and help me with the matter which they did.Be cautious here when buying as you may not get the phone you thought it would be and also guarantee is quickly cancelled when you need to use it.

    Great phone with very few marks on the screen, nothing major to affect use. However, when turning the phone on, Apple detects the battery has been changed and a non genuine battery has been used, therefore not displaying the battery health. I’ve been through the listing to double check, and nowhere does it mention the battery being changed. It does however guarantee a battery life of more than 80%, something I’m unable to check now.

The phone is good for someone who intends to upgrade from a very lower model say X or XR. I was using 13 and I can say I havent seen any difference in terms of functionality! In short, the phone looks pretty much like 14pro and operates so much like 12/13.

New camera zoom is great, but it’s not the Samsung ultra zoom. Which I would like Apple to compete. As a photography person the iPhone still camera still not good enough for 2023 cameras the iPhone 15 pro max zoom only can go up to 25x which it 10 x zoom more I’m old iPhone 13 Pro Max, the Dynamic Island is a gimmick.

    The screen still has the plastic hollow feel and this results in very noisy tapping. The noisy tapping also irritated other people in quieter environments. You can squeeze the middle of the screen with your thumbs and can feel it hitting against the battery..screen flexibility not very solid. Also, the screen seems to be quite easily scratched. I hope crapple address these issues...a terrible phone..not worth the money by any means,

    Ein bemerkenswertes Upgrade
  
  
",Reviewed in Germany on 10 October 2023,"







  
    Als langjähriger Apple Nutzer habe ich kürzlich das Vergnügen gehabt, vom iPhone 12 Pro auf das brandneue iPhone 15 Pro umzusteigen. Und ich kann mit voller Überzeugung sagen, dass es sich um eine bemerkenswerte Verbesserung handelt. Auch wie immer ein toller und vor allem schneller Service von Amazon bei der Lieferung. Danke dafür!Das iPhone 15 Pro in der Farbe Titan Weiß ist ein wahrhaft beeindruckendes Smartphone. Das Design ist elegant und modern, und die Verarbeitungsqualität ist wie gewohnt herausragend. Das edle Finish in Titan Weiß verleiht dem Gerät einen luxuriösen Touch und lässt es in jedem Umfeld stilvoll aussehen.Ein großartiges Feature des iPhone 15 Pro ist zweifellos das verbesserte Display. Die Super Retina XDR OLED Technologie sorgt für atemberaubende Farben, gestochen scharfe Details und eine beeindruckende Helligkeit. Egal ob man Filme, Fotos oder Spiele anschaut, das Display des iPhone 15 Pro bietet ein immersives Erlebnis, das einfach faszinierend ist.Aber es sind nicht nur die äußeren Merkmale, die das iPhone 15 Pro so beeindruckend machen. Die Leistung dieses Smartphones ist absolut erstklassig. Der A17 Pro Chip, kombiniert mit 256 GB Speicher, sorgt für eine blitzschnelle Geschwindigkeit und reibungslose Leistung. Das Multitasking ist ein Kinderspiel und Apps öffnen sich nahezu sofort. Das iPhone 15 Pro bietet eine unglaubliche Performance, die selbst die anspruchsvollsten Nutzer beeindrucken dürfte.Ein weiteres Highlight ist die Kamera des iPhone 15 Pro. Mit dem verbesserten Kamerasystem können atemberaubende Fotos und Videos aufgenommen werden. Die 48 MP Hauptkamera und die 12 MP Ultraweitwinkelkamera liefern beeindruckende Bildqualität, egal ob bei Tag oder Nacht. Die Kamera bietet zahlreiche Funktionen und Einstellungsmöglichkeiten, mit denen man seiner Kreativität freien Lauf lassen kann.Darüber hinaus bietet das iPhone 15 Pro eine lange Akkulaufzeit, schnelles drahtloses Laden, eine verbesserte Wasser- und Staubbeständigkeit sowie eine Vielzahl weiterer Funktionen, die das tägliche Nutzererlebnis noch angenehmer machen.Als jemand, der vom iPhone 12 Pro auf das iPhone 15 Pro gewechselt ist, kann ich mit Sicherheit sagen, dass es sich um ein bemerkenswertes Upgrade handelt. Das iPhone 15 Pro bietet eine außergewöhnliche Leistung, ein beeindruckendes Display und eine herausragende Kameraqualität. Wenn Sie auf der Suche nach einem hochwertigen Smartphone sind, das Ihnen ein erstklassiges Nutzererlebnis bietet, dann ist das iPhone 15 Pro definitiv die richtige Wahl.

    Ausgezeichnetes Smartphone zu einem gerade noch akzeptablen Preis
  
  
",Reviewed in Germany on 20 October 2023,"







  
    Das neue iPhone 15 Pro hat ein iPhone 11 Pro abgelöst, welches seinen Dienst jahrelang ohne Probleme verrichtet hat. Im Vergleich zum 11 Pro gibt es jetzt tolle neue Features bei der Kamera, die Dynamic Island, den praktischen Action Button, das Always-On Display und vieles mehr - aber das Feature das mich überzeugt und zum Kauf bewegt hat ist ProMotion. Mit den 120 Hz sind Animationen nun so was von flüssig und smooth, dass das 11 Pro im Vergleich dazu Augenschmerzen verursacht. Auf ein Display mit 60 Hz werde ich wohl nicht mehr zurückgehen können. Die 120 Hz passen nun auf jeden Fall perfekt zu meinem MacBook Pro 14"" und dem iPad Pro 11"".Einige Kritikpunkte habe ich allerdings trotzdem:- das Kameramodul ist mit jeder Generation größer geworden und hat mittlerweile ein für mich sehr grenzwertiges Ausmaß erreicht. Ist sicher Geschmacksache, aber mir gefällt dieses riesen Ding auf der Rückseite gar nicht - aber vielleicht gewöhnt man sich mit der Zeit daran.- der Preis ist im Vergleich zum Vorjahr zwar gesunken, ist aber immer noch verdammt hoch für ein Smartphone. Wenn man allerdings berücksichtigt, dass das Smartphone wohl das Gerät ist, welches man am meisten überhaupt verwendet (ist zumindest bei mir so) und eigentlich immer dabei hat, relativiert sich der hohe Preis wieder.Ich finde, das iPhone 15 Pro ist auf jeden Fall ein gelungenes Smartphone und als Upgrade von einem 11 Pro oder vielleicht sogar 12 Pro auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert. Hätte ich bereits ein 13 Pro gehabt, wäre ich bestimmt nicht umgestiegen, da Pro Motion für mich das wichtigste Feature ist und man das ja beim 13 Pro bereits hat. Klare Kaufempfehlung!

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2023,"







  
  
    Certain things just seem like they don't have to be missing, LOG recording, RAW photos, how difficult would it have been to add the action button? - Plus 60hz display still does make the phone feel needlessly sluggish, no always on display.It's frustrating that Apple are taking really basic or software only things and removing it just to force people to the Pro. I don't want the useless 3x zoom lens, I don't want the titanium, I don't need the latest chip, but basic software features and a mode modern display should've made it to this phone.

    Excellent device let down by mediocre battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2022,"







  
  
    Everything about this phone is great apart from battery life. It is however as expected - have had only iPhones and they are all let down by the battery life. Yes, one can argue depends on usage and it’s true but phone users we tend to use them extensively and continually for more purposes. You lose about 30-40% of battery daily. Not a big deal now when I’ve just bought it but it will gradually deteriorate further.Other than that, it’s an excellent device. Face recognition, privacy, screen size and display, camera and quality of photographs, functionality, smooth tab transitions etc. It also looks really nice in lilac colour.Overall I love this phone, it is a quality device but battery life could somewhat be improved by Apple across the board.Final point to add is that a current reduced price reflects the worth of this iPhone 12 but the regular price is not justified whatsoever- don’t buy it at £800+ .

    This is an amazing phone.It has great fingerprint and fine camera quality.The battery may run out fast but charges quite quickly.The only mishap is that a individual app may exit, it may be the app itself but other than that it is wonderful for an iphone 8! I would recommend for your child's first phone so they can get used to it instead of breaking an expensive phone.My 12 year old son loves it and it works perfectly fine.

Here is the thing u need to know if u bought the 256gb then u won’t get it for some reason u will only get 64gb however the packaging phone is really good but if talking about charger and the pin you it won’t be in it best form specially the pin . It is super good with affordable price we are getting . If your buying this phone for any gaming then trust me it’s works really good.the bad thing about this phone is that if it reaches a certain temperature then it will start to lag but overal is really good

    iPhone 13 Pro: Familiar but Incredibly Different
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2021,"







  
  
    This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well. Just click on my profile picture and you will see it as the first review on my profile.

    Broken phone customer device is appalling
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2022,"







  
  
    Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn’t charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn’t work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over £1000 and still without my money or my phone.

    I normally buy the non pro version of iPhone but prices and specification with the impending  release of the iPhone 14 changed my options.I wanted the larger version iPhone 14 but the price had rocketed to £949.I was getting a slightly bigger screen but last years processor!!!The iPhone 13 Pro was available from Amazon, so I got the Pro cameras, the Pro motion display and those little extras you get with a Pro (including the sexy stainless steel for the same cash outlay £949.The Pro is amazing, the extra 6 x optical zoom lens and 15 x digital zoom lens is staggering when compared to the iPhone 12 and the whole phone looks so much better.So I ended up without a bigger screen but got so much more.I bought the blue version and I love it.

    Changed product three times
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2022,"







  
  
    I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

    Much better option
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2023,"







  
  
    Was definitely sceptical buying from Amazon renewed but decided that is was worth the risk considering the apple prices and the 30 day time window to send it back if there were any problems.The phone arrived a day early in great condition. No visible scratches anywhere on the phone. Needed a slight clean in areas but nothing too bad. Looked like some slight glue resin from a screen replacement but came off very easily. Been using the phone for a few days now and everything works perfectly. The battery was at 87% which is fine with me considering It’s relatively cheap to get a new one from apple if needed.I would recommend checking the seller reviews through Amazon when deciding which one to buy. I went through stock must go who had a 70%+ review rating I wouldn’t recommend buying anything from sellers with less than that.

    I'll be the first to admit I felt dubious spending ~£500 on a used phone that I can't see but bit the bullet and ordered it. There was no need to be worried, it arrived quicker than estimated and in perfect condition. Setup was nice and easy and relatively quick, it came with everything I needed and I couldn't be happier having saved a nice chunk of cash

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2022,"







  
  
    Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

    Very good phone, iOS software is not as intuitive as it used to be, and iPhones are a lot less user friendly than the Samsung I’ve switched from. I almost sent it back it was so frustrating. After time I’ve gotten used to the quirks, and not being able to do lots of things I’ve done for years on other phones. The phone itself is 4 stars because the cameras are good, but I often miss a better optical zoom Lens. And that ‘pill’ notch is just bad. 7 years ago I had a phone with no visible front camera, an edge to edge display. Catch up, Apple!

    Best Phone I’ve ever seen.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2022,"







  
  
    This iPhone is a huge step up from any other I’ve ever seen or used and I’ve had iPhones since the iPhone 3g. The camera is stunning and I’m a semi-professional photographer. I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed.This is technology at its very best and if you want the best mobile phone available today, I heartily recommend you go for this. It even has a battery that will get you through an entire long day! Not that it matters too much as I can charge mine from empty to 80% in under an hour.This isn’t the place for the kind of review this phone deserves but I can say with confidence you will not regret buying it.As a side issue, my friend and I ordered our phones on the exact same day, he from Apple and me from Amazon. I got my phone at least two weeks before he did!

    Unexpected disappointment
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2023,"







  
  
    I was hugely disappointed with the 14 max pro 256gb I had purchased recently.1. The system in settings does not correspond with the online instructions.2. Interface between the iphone system and apps and functions is awkward and counter intuitive. There is no function ""select all"" or a simple © or ° etc signs on the keyboard.3. The brand new iphone overheats while charging!!!4. There is no function to save to the home screen.5. I was unable to find instructions on how to customise my daily memory photo selection, apart from deleting the photos I do wish to see on a daily basis, and had to have this function switched off.6. The iphone email app looked very untidy and chaotic and I kept Google Gmail, which does not seem to work that well with an iPhone interface.While outwardly the iPhone presents handsome looks and some attractive features, in fact I am still unable to fully transfer my previous Android to it as it does not have the convenient features of Android I still need to use. So, in the end I have to move about with two phones: one iPhone and one Android.Buying 14 pro max was a very expensive experiment. I was hoping to upgrade my online and digital interface experience and did not realise it would bring so much stress and confusion into my life. To start with, I believe the iPhone should offer specific instructions and even warnings on the features one would lose by moving from Android to iOS.The screenshot is of the three months free appleTV subscription which came with the purchase of the phone. This is what I have got in fact, with no other options.

    Honestly if get this phone over the 8 pro, it basically has all the same features minus a camera. It's super fast and easy to use and you can take some of the best pictures whilst on the go!The price point and the added extra of the ear buds were a nice touch and I now use them daily too.Also, I find the keyboard nice to use with its haptic feedback and makes typing easier and quick than most phones.

    Finalmente ci siamo
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 14 October 2023,"







  
    Da fan dei Googlefonini ho avuto praticamente tutti i Pixel usciti fino ad oggi e devo ammettere che dopo il Pixel 5 non mi hanno mai convinto per estetica, schermo e processore, quindi in concomitanza con il restyling del design e la nascita del SoC proprietario G Tensor (base Exynos Samsung). Pare che con questa serie 8 e il Tensor G3 hanno trovato la quadra.Partiamo con il display dove hanno fatto un notevole miglioramento, netto, siamo ai livelli di un Samsung s23. Colori ben tarati, nessuna tinta strana, se inclinato non soffre di blue/red shift. Luminosità altissima. È migliorato tanto il display rispetto al Pixel 7.Altro miglioramento (per adesso) riguarda temperature e surriscaldamento durante l'utilizzo su rete mobile. Prime configurazioni e prime due giornate di utilizzo nessun problema nessuna criticità, anche l'autonomia ne guadagna e l'ho notato fin da subito (parlo sempre di utilizzo sotto rete 4g/5g), oltretutto siamo ancora al 3º giorno di commercializzazione quindi devono ancora affinare il software, e sono sicuro che migliorerà ancora. Altro miglioramento importante: costruzione e design. Assemblato in modo eccellente, è piu compatto e leggero, bordi leggermente più sottili, display più a filo con il vetro e il piccolo restyling con linee più morbide (angoli arrotondati) lo aspettavo proprio, frontalmente sembra davvero un altro smartphone rispetto al Pixel 7.Ricezione ancora devo valutare per bene ma pare sia tutto nella norma, non è ne eccellente ne problematica, se si perde la linea il riaggancio è rapido. Audio in chiamata ottimo.Piccolo miglioramento anche per quanto riguarda il lettore impronte, funziona da subito bene, anche utilizzando una pellicola in vetro trovata d'occasione qui su Amazon (che cambierò appena possibile con una clear-coat oppure una Zagg).7 anni di aggiornamenti software, roba da fare (quasi) impallidire la🍏, ma probabilmente cambierete smartphone molto prima.Aggiungo che quest'anno con la partnership Google-Uni€ur0 a breve si troveranno moltissime cover e accessori anche per i Google Pixel.Poi per quanto riguarda altre cose come audio degli speakers, fotocamera o feedback aptico, al momento mi sembra esattamente uguale al 7 ma l'8 ha molti più margini di miglioramento per quanto riguarda la fotocamera.I difetti riscontrati per ora sono gli stessi che ho avuto con tutti gli altri modelli: ricarica abbastanza lenta (27w) che nel 2023 a 800€ non è accettabile, USB Type-c 3.2 ma SENZA uscita video tramite cavo (come sempre è bloccato da Google via software), Selfie-cam solo accettabile, gestione RAM delle app in background ancora incerta, ho fatto un test con un iphone SE 2022 e su 10 app aperte il Pixel ne ricarica 5 mentre l'iPhone nemmeno una, probabilmente Google deve sistemare qualcosina tramite aggiornamento software. Infine le memorie che ""solo"" UFS 3.1 anziche 4.0, questo perí più per un discorso in ottica futura.In ogni caso valuterò il device nel tempo e sicuramente aggiornerò la recensione.

    Ottimo smartphone ma con qualche pecca
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 23 October 2023,"







  
    Ho avuto in passato nexus, dopo un periodo più o meno lungo con one+ ho deciso di tornare alle origini e di ritentare la strada android stock, questo sembrava il dispositivo giusto... NI!A livello di funzionalità nulla da dire, preso con il bundle ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, ma avviso già che mi son piaciute di più le pixel buds pro. Il pixel 8 va davvero bene, sia a livello hardware che ad usabilità generale, lo uso parecchio e in configurazione doppia sim, ma ad oggi non so se fare il reso, perché purtroppo mi cade su un dettaglio fin troppo fondamentale per il mio utilizzo: dalla scheda tecnica non sembra, ma la 🔋 dura un po troppo poco... per il mio utilizzo le 07:00 - 22:00 sono fondamentali, il telefono mi deve arrivare vivo, e faccio circa 5 ore erotte di utilizzo (mail, WhatsApp, chiamate, ricerche google, cazzeggio nei tempi morti...) non lo uso sicuramente per giocare. Detto questo mi arriva pericolosamente sotto il 10%, e con impostazioni di risparmio energetico abbastanza conservative (mi parte il risparmio energetico al 75% di batteria e tutte le app gravose sono impostate ""con limitazioni""), diciamo che da una batteria da 4600 mha e un display da 6.2 pollici speravo un po meglio, ma alla fine la giornata la faccio

    Questo Pixel 8 è un ottimo telefono sia lato software e hardware, oltreché essere molto bello!Finalmente anche lo sblocco con il volto funziona anche con le app come quelle bancarie, il che è molto comodo, e riesce ad affiancare un già buono sblocco biometrico.Come ogni Pixel all'inizio presenta qualche piccolo bug, ma sono certo che con i prossimi aggiornamenti verranno sistemati tutti.Se devo trovare un neo, avrei optato per uno schermo leggermente piu grande come un 6.4""

    Sono solo le prime impressioni essendo passati 2 giorni dall'acquisto ma sono molto positive! Il display ha dei neri decisamente profondi e un'ottima luminosità. Trovo il sensore d'impronta migliorato rispetto a P6 e P7, pur essendo ancora di tipo ottico. La qualità costruttiva è notevole. Ai livelli di Apple.

     First impressions of the phone is that it feels really good in your hand. It feels pretty premium. The screen is clear and it comes with a case. The screen is pretty good, not high end refresh rate, but good nevertheless. Android works quickly and you don't notice that this isn't a flagship phone. It comes with charging cable and adapter (not many supply one). This charges the phone at 18w, which is pretty fast.The camera is pretty good too and you can get some pretty good shots. Not so good in low light, but acceptable.I've used this phone for a week now and it is pretty good for a daily driver. I got the silver which looks amazing.I you want a pretty good phone for not that much money, this is a good one to consider.

    Product arrived with a screen protector and case already applied to keep it safe, all features clearly explained with the information tabs and booklets provided. Camera is very good and has some useful extras. The phone runs very fast and smooth, but there are a few small bugs in the firmware that I'm sure will get fixed in updates. All round a very good purchase for the price

    Looks a great phone on paper but the reality is different. In the few weeks I owned it the Bluetooth kept constantly turning off and on and got to the point that it was unusable. The phone also failed to boot up and had to have a hard reset so again wasting time setting it all up again. Sent it back and fair play to Amazon the refund was quickly sorted. Bought a Xiaomi redmi note 11pro 5g from Amazon as previous phone was Xiaomi so trusted the brand

    An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands
  
",Reviewed in the United States on 20 July 2023,"







  
  
    I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.

     Took my Pixel 8 Pro away the first weekend I got it. My pro camera didn't leave my bag. All top end smartphones these days talk about being great cameras but there was two AI assisted areas the 8 pro camera blew my mind. Astro mode for Astronomy and the stabilisation in video mode (even when zooming).I've attached some examples and the results speak for themselves. The Astronomy pictures I took were just my pixel on a tripod and nothing more, no tracker and no external stacking. Just set up, out in Night Sight mode and wait for the stars to appear on the shutter button. Then it will take a series of long exposures and process (stack) all the images took in 3-4 mins and boom, professional level dark sky photos.If you look at the video sample I uploaded too, you can see how smooth the footage is stabilised at all levels of zoom. No gimbal or grips used at all. Just gorgeous footage with minimal effort.All if this is made perfect thanks to the nee display. That extra brightness makes a huge difference when editing on the move in bright sunny scenarios.

    DE MOMENTO UN 10
  
  
",Reviewed in Spain on 15 October 2023,"







  
    Bien por Google y su Pixel 8 pro. Tengo aún mi 7 pro, que con Android 14 tuvo una mejora bastante apreciable, siendo ya un gran smartphone. El 8 lo supera en pantalla, en fotografía y en velocidad y fluidez, aunque no son diferencias muy notables en el día a día. Es cierto que el brillo máximo de esta versión es tremendo, pero con el 7 nunca noté falencias. La pantalla es muy buena y la calidad de construcción muy, muy buena. Se ha refinado mucho respecto a otras generaciones. El diseño es de un Pixel. Lo amas o lo odias. Es como un iPhone, inconfundible y eso es algo que me gusta porque tiene mucho carácter. En todas las reviws cansan con la poca velocidad del procesador y la carga rápida, esto último como en Samsung y Apple. No necesito quemar la batería para que se cargue en 5 minutos. En ese sentido, estas tres marcas lo hacen bien. Yo lo uso con una base de carga inalámbrica que cuida mucho la batería. Si lo pones a cargar de noche es mejor hacerlo con un cable porque este carga hasta un 70% y detiene la carga hasta la mañana para cuidar la batería. Son detalles de android14 y del teléfono. Y bueno, se ha generalizado la expresión: es el iPhone de Google. Es cierto, ya que su interface es única y su aprovechamiento de los recursos excelente. La subida de precio de justifica? Yo creo que si. Mantener la política de precios contenidos desvaloriza el producto.Compré el de 128 GB de almacenamiento porque los de 256 y 512 tardaban mucho en llegar. En el apartado fotográfico es un 10, mucho mejor que iPhone 14 o 15 y vos a probarlo con el S23 ultra, aunque es una batalla difícil, porque el Samsung es verdaderamente una bestia en todo los aspectos a un precio similar con 256gb de RAM. Creo que ahí se pudo ajustar más el precio y dejar los 128 GB a unos 900€. Es mi opinión. El almacenamiento es muy importante porque también afecta al rendimiento del teléfono, pero suelo tener todo en la nube y es una solución a medias. El tema es el apartado fotográfico. Yo tiro todo en Raw. Es decir en calidad máxima lo que implica un formato en bruto, sin perdida de información, con la pega de que una foto de 50 mega pixeles, pasa de tener 2 o 3 megas en jpg, a más de 10 según la foto y el formato.Conclusión, un producto excelente pero no para todo el mundo. Si quieres usarlo como gamer y que cargue echando humo la batería, este no es tu teléfono. Si quieres un producto de calidad, equilibrado, eficiente y con pantalla y cámara pro, este es tu teléfono.Ah, se me olvida. El 7 pro pecaba de una batería muy justa para mi gusto. En este es estupenda. Hay una diferencia muy importante en la duración y carga de la batería si lo conectas a un cargador.En resumen, lo recomiendo al 100% si te gusta la experiencia de Android casi puro, eso es una pasada, y tener un teléfono eficiente en todos los de todos. Otra cosa es el sonido. Impresionante la mejora respecto a la versión anterior. Tien un sonido con cuerpo y potente, casi equiparable a un iPhone, aunque el último que probé, el 14 pro Max, no me pareció tan brillante en este aspecto.Muy recomendable.

    Come temperature ci siamo, sicuramente meglio di Pixel 7 Pro che era un fornellino portatile.Per ora la batteria mi sembra che vada giù piu rapidamente ma aspetto di avere un riscontro di almeno una settimana.Complessivamente è poco piu del 7 Pro, un po piu stondato nei bordi, ma la solita minestra, niente di WOW (il sensore di temperatura è inutile)Seguiranno sicuramente aggiornamenti.

    Tras un par de días de uso intensivo puede decirse que seguramente sea el mejor móvil del mercado actualmente.La mejor cámara, incluso superando la del nuevo iPhone y un rendimiento extraordinario, con una experiencia de usuario Android inigualable. Las posibilidades de edición de imagen y asistente que ofrece Google no se pueden comparar con ningún otro fabricante.La batería llega perfectamente al final del día, aunque si es cierto que la carga no es muy rápida.El precio es superior al de salida de otros modelos aunque se compensa algo con la promoción inicial de los auriculares.Actualmente no hay nada a su nivel y menos por este precio.

    Ich habe das Google Pixel 8 Pro mit meinem alten OnePlus 8T verglichen. Das OnePlus hat Android 13 mit Pixel Experience installiert, daher ist die Software und das Interface nahezu identisch.In Bezug auf die Leistung ist der Snapdragon 865 des OnePlus 8T dem Tensor G3 des Pixel 8 Pro ebenbürtig. Der Tensor G3 ist zwar etwas schneller, aber der Unterschied ist nicht spürbar. In Spielen ist der Tensor G3 nur mittelmäßiig, was aber zu erwarten war.Die größten Unterschiede liegen beim Display, der Kamera und den Lautsprechern. Das Display des Pixel 8 ist deutlich heller und kontrastreicher als das des OnePlus 8T. Die Kamera des Pixel 8 Pro ist ebenfalls deutlich besser, insbesondere bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen. Die Lautsprecher des Pixel 8 Pro sind zudem sehr gut und bieten einen satten Klang.Zu den Nachteilen des Pixel 8 Pro gehören die Wärmeentwicklung und die Akkulaufzeit. Das Smartphone wird bei einfachen Aufgaben wie App-Updates warm. Der Akku hält nur einen Tag, ohne Reserve.Insgesamt ist das Pixel 8 Pro ein gutes Smartphone, aber es bietet nicht genug Fortschritt, um den Preis zu rechtfertigen. Das Display ist das Highlight, aber das Smartphone fühlt sich nicht wie ein Flaggschiff des Jahres 2023 an.

    Super phone, excited that i finally switched to Pixel. Overall impressions for the first day, battery from this morning until now at 8 pm is at 75% which is great, tested the cameras and they are very sharp, the phone is super fast, very loud and clear speakers, one thing that i don't like but its not only this phone, but all Pixels, is that there isn't a dedicated gallery app like on most phones, is just google photos.

    A little bit sticky on the keys  and face recognition is - a pain
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2023,"







  
  
    Hard to know as one who wears glasses whether to take them off to leave them on for facial recognition.  Generally, on ... but my word it's a pain if you're using your phone in bed sans glasses and having to key in the password each time.  Isn't there an option for either -or in the advanced world of Appledom? The phone itself is quite nice but not as intuitive as I'd hoped and I'm still working out how to edit the Home Screen and add stuff I really want rather than stuff inflicted on me.  I pine my old iPhone 6, yes 6, which went without updates for so long and yet still performed relatively well.  Big mistake to buy the salmon pink cover for such a pretty blue phone too.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2023,"







  
  
    The phones works but the battery life is only 80 percent. The phone is advertised as excellent condition and will work and look pretty much as new… except this phone had a million scratches on the rim all the way around and was marked as a grade B on the box - which had been crossed out but I could still see. It also said 80 percent battery on the box - again crossed out but not well enough.The back and the front of the phone looked good so in a case it wasnt really that bad.Considering iPhone costs, it’s a ok phone but I wouldnt advertise as excellent and looks as new because it will just cause more complaints! I nearly sent it back when I saw the battery life and all the scratches!!- lucky I was desperate!  If this was excellent I’d hate to see the condition of the ‘good’ option. But overall it does work and in the case looks all good!

    Refurbed iPhone screen breaks 3 weeks after purchase
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2023,"







  
  
    The phone worked for 3 weeks and then screen became unusable - when queried I was only offered a refund and no compensation for having to drive to Apple Store and get phone emptied and restored. All in all this handset cost me 7 hours of my time plus fuel for a 40 min drive there AND back and postage to return the item - was told at Apple Store the phone did not have an Apple screen on and that’s why it broke - would like compensation for my time and fuel but was told by vendor this is not going to be done

    So a bit of history about me that led me to buying this.  I have had pretty much every iphone since they first appeared.  The 4/4s and 5 remain my favourite.  The mIni shares many design cues with those which was part of th eappeal.However the real appeal was that I wanted a small, light premium phone after lugging my iphone 11 around since it came out.So I took the plunge and decided to get the 12 mini despite it being a drastic drop in screen size and on arrival I wonder if I had done the right thing.The phone comes in the usual premium Apple packaging minus a charger which is fine.  I went for the white one, and its more off white but stunning.Immediately it felt at home in my hand.  Setup is mega easy, I just turned it on next to my 11 and about half hour later all my apps, photos and settings were transferred.  Some additional setup was needed for banking apps and signing into Apple Pay but thats fine and expected.Its light and the design is spot on.  I started to have a play and contrast against my 11 and initially i felt it was the wrong choice but now the 11 feels completely alien to me.The OLED screen is lovely and the difference by comparison to my 11 is amazing.  A few videos latter and the screen has won me over.The key point for me is using it one handed is a joy again.  Moving about the gym with it is a joy again, generally living with it so far has been joyful.The camera is superb and in particular low light pictures are a win.Battery life, it has a small battery.  As an 'average' user I get through the day fine.  At a push I could get almost 2 days out of my 11, this wont do that but gets me through my average day.  When I'm int he car using carplay the phone is charging, in fact most places I have access to charge if need be.The build quality is fantastic.  Every bit the premium phone and this time I went for white which I am loving.I have encountered one issue that has been reported on by the tech press, and that is if you fit a screen protector and a case, there is an intermittent issue where the screen doesnt respond to a swipe.  I notice that maybe one in ten swipes to unlock requires me to reswipe.  Hoping Apple resolve this with a software fix and that it is not hardware.  Though Apple I know are better than most offering support programs to fix any problems.Overall, the camera, screen and build are amazing and this is the perfect phone for me against a trend of making phones bigger and bigger.  There are compromises such as average battery and the aforementioned problem.  Theres even 5g support when that becomes available.

    Great replacement for my old 5s
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 June 2022,"







  
  
    After my 5s it took some time to adjust and I miss the thumb recognition, especially as covid hit and masks became necessary. The mask face recognition is hit and miss. When using apple pay in stores this can be an inconvenience.The battery is far superior to my 5s, but is still lacking when in heavy use.I also miss the audio jack, I've had this phone 4 months now and really need to find some wireless headphones. I rarely use headphones so cheap £5 plug-in's were so much more convenient to me, than having something extra to keep charged up.But overall I love this phone, it's fast, faster than my laptop in processing speeds. It's the perfect size as I need a  phone, not a small tablet in my pocket.The screen and camera are great, the photos are as good as any camera I've had. And it's a pleasure to watch movies on.It has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 metres up to 30 minutes)My phone did get wet once (dropped while reading in the bath) and I went to charge it later and a warning came up telling me to let it dry. I've had zero issues since, so I'm very impressed by this.**********Edit after nearly a year of ownership.My new phone accidentally found its way in the washing machine. I thankfully realised quickly and got it out within 5 minutes and after drying out it works as well as it ever has. Amazing. I thought it was a goner.Also the mask/face recognition issue has been greatly improved with updates.I still occasionally miss the audio jack, but it’s not worth losing a star over so I’m upgrading my rating to 5*.

    Going from a 10R to a 12 mini.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2020,"







  
  
    Coming from a 10R to a 12 mini.The 10R was one of the best iPhones I’ve ever had, it was the first time I was introduced to the edge to edge display and the game changing Face ID and the best battery iv ever had in an iPhone, there technically wasn’t anything wrong with my 10R but my dad has an iPhone 4 and is not one to go out and buy himself a new phone but wait till one of us hands him down one of our old ones and when I saw the 12 mini it intrigued me! So I decided to go for it and get one (and I’ll give my dad my old 10R.... good son or what!) tho there was a couple of things I was worried about, one: how would I feel going from a bigger phone to a smaller one and two: going from the best battery in an iPhone to one not so grate, well iv had this phone for a week now and.... I love it! The size is not a major difference really, only by an inch or two I think, but the small iPhone 5 like body with the iPhone 10 display is brilliant and just looks and feels like an iPhone should, I thought with going with a smaller display I would need to increase the text size for my ageing eyes but i found this isn’t necessary and the small body with the iPhone 5 flat edges rather than curved ones we’ve had since iPhone 6 feels grate in the hand and I’m able to do something iv not done in a while... use my phone with the one hand! The next thing was battery, iv actually watched a battery drain test video on YouTube and was surprised to see the 12 mini died the same time as the 10R and all week iv been paranoidly checking my battery health to see how fast it’s going down and I’m finding that it’s lasting just as long as my 10R did ending the day with just over half the battery left (this is with my own general use, not a heavy user and don’t play games) so I was really chuffed about that!All in all this is a grate phone and I’d say my best iPhone yet and I’m glad I went for it.

    Upgrade from iPhone 8 - haven’t looked back
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2021,"







  
  
    I bought my last iPhone (iPhone 8) back not long after it was released so I was definitely due an upgrade. I purchased the 12 mini when it was on offer during Prime Day - and I’m so glad I did. I’d forgotten what it’s like to have a phone that actually lasts all day - the 8 required mid-day charges quite quickly after I bought it so I had chargers dotted all around my life for convenience. I think I’ve only had to use them with the 12 mini a couple of times in the months I’ve had it.Other plus points - it’s fast, 128gb storage means I no longer have to offload apps to save space, and the size is absolutely perfect - it fits in my jeans front pocket easily (the “normal” 12 is too big for your pocket to be comfortable. I’m a huge advocate that if I want a big screen I’ll use my iPad - my iPhone is for convenience, messaging and calls.The camera is brilliant - has lifted my photos to a whole new level. I must admit though, I don’t rate the wide angle lens much - it creates a bit of a fish-eye distort to pictures which I’m not a fan of. The decent front facing camera is great for selfies though. And I really love portrait mode how it blurs the background behind the subject.This is my first phone with FaceID. Mixed opinion - in many ways it’s nice and convenient - when it works. But if for some reason it’s having a moment and doesn’t recognise your face, it’s a pain. I’d say I have more difficulty opening my phone with faceid than I have ever had with TouchID. Given the choice I’d go back to touch. And when wearing a face mask it’s a pain!All in all, I’m very happy with my new phone and I’m expecting it to last many years.

    Excellent small iPhone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2020,"







  
  
    Review UPDATED December 2020.Been using the device for almost 4 weeks now and thought the review needed an update.The device is really nice to hold in the hand. Very compact and well built. I have been after a good small phone and this has been excellent. Beautiful display clarity and brightness. Notch is still there but if you buy one of these iPhones then I am assuming you are ok with it.Overall performance is excellent and I decided to keep the device. I also had the pixel 4a which is another excellent small phone. Very comparable in a lot of ways but obviously huge price difference. If you are after a high end, compact smartphone then you should be happy with the mini.I’ve had 5G off since day one. It is not really available in most places as of right now and drains battery quicker. My brightness is set to auto. Dark mode set to auto turn on and off with dusk and dawn. With all the above in mind, the small battery has been excellent. No exaggeration at all. Battery life is fantastic. I am as surprised as anyone! There are days I get easily over 6 hours screen on time and more. I have Bluetooth on all times and connected to my galaxy watch. WiFi on pretty much all day as I work from home. Have not had any issues with battery, which was my main worry before buying the mini.Now please keep in mind that I am not a gamer on my phone. I do not play high end games. My battery life has been based on normal usage. Phone calls, emails, web browsing, some streaming services, music and using the camera. Just normal day to day stuff. Very pleasantly surprised. Comfortably making a full day and then some.Excellent small phone and I would highly recommend.

    Surprisingly Good
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 May 2022,"







  
  
    I have used this as a daily phone for a number of days now and so far the battery has been fine. Some reviews did make me worry. Recently had the battery replaced on my GF's old iPhone for £55 so even if this modest battery does conk out after a couple of years (if some of these reviews are to be taken seriously) then i think I can cope with the low expense of a replacement. I use the phone for calls, texts on various apps, and pretty heavy use of Discord and its been great. Despite it's small size I haven't had too much trouble texting but admittedly it is currently more difficult than my older huge 6.5 inch screen zenfone. I will get used to the size and I will get used to using ioS and then will be able to use the phone as proficiently as an android.The only bad thing is colours look bland but that is half because of the fact I tend to over saturate my phones and tv pictures because I like a colourful screen. The screen can be made 'warmer' however but it certainly isn't as adjustable as an android. There may be apps available that can help but like I say am new to ios.The product red colour really pops.Face recognition makes life so easy too. I prefer it to finger print ( a function this iphone does not have) .

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2022,"







  
  
    I said I’d never ever spend anywhere near £600 for a phone but I found this and thought I haven’t had a brand new phone for years and if I can afford it then why not. I’ve also never had one with so much storage so I found myself downloading apps and games that I probably won’t use. I’ve had rose gold/pink phones for years now so thought I’d come away from that as I liked the purple. I also decided to pay it off in the 5 monthly instalments to make it even easier.It arrived quickly and I was eager to get it set up..However.. it doesn’t come with a plug.. so I then had to go out to my nearest supermarket and spend even more money on a charging plug so I could actually turn it on. I  upgraded from a 6s so I couldn’t even use that one. For the amount of money you spend Apple should still at least give you the full charging accessory.After setting it up I had a little play around as it’s got some extra things I hadn’t had before. Sound is decent, screen size is good, overall phone size is good. Face recognition works well..It’s overall a pretty good phone with the bonus of the nice colour instead of plain white or black.

    The best small iPhone to date!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2021,"







  
  
    Apple iPhone 12 mini 128gb £599 from Amazon Prime. A great deal to good to pass up. Was considering the iPhone SE 64gb £399 or £449 for the 128gb, but when I saw this mini at a reduced  price it made more sense now. Original price for iPhone 12 mini 64gb at £699 which is £300 more than the SE version so the question is, is the mini 12 worth £300 more than the SE? NO! Is it worth £150 more? That’s an astounding YES! So go and treat yourself to the best small iPhone from Amazon prime.Review update: Started watching The Walking Dead season 9 and thought I’ll test the iPhone mini 12 battery life. So after fully charged 100% I continued watching using the Prime app from season 9, episode 6, 54min  episode 7, 43min  episode 8, 44min  episode 9, 51min  episode 10, 45min  episode 11, 41min  episode 12, 44min  episode 13, 40min  episode 14, 45min  episode 15, 57min  episode 16, 46minIn between episodes Amazon throws in around 30sec ads for other TV series. The iPhone mini 12 still had 15% ( red ) and I recharged using the official Apple 20w usb-c charger, and it took a little over 2hrs to fully charge to 100%. Honestly I don’t see any issues with battery life. It’s a small phone so naturally comes with a small battery, but after this showing I’m impressed.

    Sleek fast and you don’t need a backpack to carry it around
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2021,"







  
  
    Great phone, I wanted a phone I could comfortably use that wasn’t as massive as the other phones on the market today. I’m a swipe to text guy so the 12 mini is perfect as it’s easy to text one handed. The screen is great, bright and crisp and is super responsive. Forget the reviews who say it’s only 60hz refresh rate. There’s nothing you will be doing on your phone that’s over 60hz, it’s a phone not a gaming pc so it handles everything perfectly.I was concerned about the potential battery life before I bought the phone but I can honestly say it’s never died on me. My average phone screen time is about 3 hours day so I end up charging it every day and a half to 2 days. I bought an apple plug so I could fast charge and it charges nice and fast ( not as fast as my previous one plus 5t ).The main reason I bought the iPhone 12 mini instead of a new Samsung or even the latest oneplus offering was, the Samsung is absolutely massive. The oneplus ( albeit cheaper and good bang for buck ) just couldn’t compare to the camera quality and overall user experience.People ask me how I can watch movies and videos on a screen that’s this size and my honest answer is: I have 4K TVs for a reason. My phone is used as a phone and camera, some email and web browsing and small amounts of media consumption here and there, Netflix or YouTube binges are reserved for the tv

    It's a one-handed iPhone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2021,"







  
  
    The iPhone 12 Mini’s build quality, speed and task handling are the same to my untrained eye as the Max’s. Indeed, the oddest observation I can make is the zero difference I have experienced reading, texting and photo editing compared to the larger iPhone.Reading social media feeds is no different at all. Text on the iPhone 12 Mini doesn’t seem smaller in day to day use. Perhaps it might do in a side-by-side comparison.Using the iPhone 12 Mini is a joy. It is bliss when leaving home with a phone that slips into a pocket and stays unnoticed.The Mini is light even when compared to my wife’s iPhone 11 Pro. I can’t believe how much heavier my wife’s Pro phone feels.So far, so good.The iPhone 12 Mini works with MagSafe accessories and is capable of fast charging, so at least I haven’t wasted the expense of those items (Apple MagSafe Wallet and Charger).Unlike the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the Mini is comfortable to hold, easier to type on and works.But, there’s always a but.There are only two issues that weaken my long-term commitment to the concept of an iPhone Mini-sized phone:No telephoto lens - I miss some photo opportunities.A weaker battery - Always start the day on a full charge to avoid getting caught out.I don't regret buying the Mini, especially when Amazon cut the price by £100. But in an ideal world, I'd prefer an iPhone Mini Pro.

Beautiful pictures sharpe and has multi function for photography.I choose a brand new one. You can get reconditioned or good at a cheaper rate.The phone came with a 100% charge.Totally recommend Apple and Amazon phone came the next day with security code.Highly recommended.

    I have never used iPhone before for the last 22 years since starting to use the phone but I am liking it now. It has got good lasting battery compared to Samsung however some of its features are different from Samsung but will have to adjust in my learning. Nice phone and I would recommend it to anyone.

    Had to get an upgrade after my previous phone broke (and wasn’t cost effective to repair).Feels slower in terms of refresh rate (than even my XS Max), worse reception than my previous phone (not sure if that’s due to design) and was quite expensive.On the plus side: better battery, more screen real estate, all the functionality of a modern smartphone and better storage capacity as stock.

    The best iPhone yet
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2022,"







  
  
    Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2023,"







  
  
    As usual, I bought it impulsively, the only excuse was that my previous  iPhone had 86%battery capacity. And the Amazon price was excellent:).No regrets, this one feels and handles better from many aspects : great battery life, bigger screen, snappier .I don’t take routinely photos with the phone therefore I wasn’t particularly interested in the camera quality. From some random photos taken seems to be excellent.It is very important to get a good quality case , otherwise will feel bulky and difficult to fit into a shirt or tight jeans pocket (I’m not wearing  tight jeans).Definitely recommend , not sure if it is a significant upgrade from iPhone12 but… why not?

    The phone is a good size and works fine apart from one issue. The ringtone volume controls both message alerts and notifications and even on full volume you can't hear the notifications that's if you get any at all. I have been in touch with apple about this issue but the seem to unable to resolve this problem pity because it is a great phone other than that. Not the first one that I have had in the 14 series I have had three and they all have the same problem, sort it apple.

    The screen is so crystal clear 😍 the chrome sides are stunning! The battery is fantastic and the camera is so clear and it’s so fast.The only cons I would say is the phone is so heavy and the camera stick out quite a bit. But personally I don’t mind it too much! It’s something that I will get used to over time.

    Great quality speakers
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2023,"







  
  
    These speakers are great quality. I use this in the kitchen/diner for music when cooking, cleaning and having guests over. Its never too quiet, the sound can fill the whole room with good quality and have more to give.There is integration to Amazon Alexa and to Goggle Assistant. I found the Google integration was completely useless and did not work at all, that was my preferred option so had to go with Alexa in the end. That being said, the Alex integration works perfect with no issues. Although i do find the voice control sometimes does not work top tier. I'm not bothered about that, but you may of course be.For me the sound is what i judge this speaker on. SONOS also provide the SONOS home app on your phone. This is actually pretty good and kind of works like spotify. Essentially a free streaming service for music with ads unless you buy premium. I dont tend to use it but did give it a go and liked all the curated playlists and radio stations they have made.

    I like that it’s a decent bit of kit and a good speaker .Aesthetically it is good as well .I hooked it up to Spotify and it plays some small playlists I have but it will NOT play ,shuffle or deal with my main Spotify playlist because it’s too big .It’s not a network/internet /anything like that issue it just Sonos application  can’t cope with a big playlist so buffers and brings up error message .A bit ridiculous in 2023.Everything else plays fine in Spotify .I should have gone for Amazon Echo Studio .Disappointing.

    Ive just recently ordered another sonos one, going quadraphoic. The gen 2 ones are a great sound speaker by themselves, the quality is superior to most small speakers, I've purchased a few small BT speaker over the years, then bought a sondcore boom, a absolutely serious BT speaker. I use it in my truck. But any whoos, Hifi has always been my passion,bought my sonos one gen 2 last year,was very impressed, then bought the mini sub (its not mini) game changer.they say this is a budget system, I disagree this is high end.And I know you can spend thousands on sound systems. If you love music, and want a perfect music system that won't disappoint, i so recommend this, the good thing is you can buy it bit by bit. Cannot possibly give a better review than this, other than you coming round my house and listening for yourself. Fidelity bass clarity, first  class.

    I got one... two... then three...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2020,"







  
  
    I started with just one of these speakers. First thoughts its easy to set up. App is reliable, makes it super easy to play music.I then brought a second to create a stereo pair... that was the WOW factor. It completely changes the listening experience. The audio sounds so much richer. I was shocked on how much it changed the music I was playing and now there's two we havent actually gone above 50% volume 🤭 because its so loud.We was so impressed we brought a third for the bedroom. Now I can play music everywhere while I'm wondering around and doing the house work!My issues with these speakers... all three of them in fact.ALEXA just seems to have bugs on Sonos.1st. If your broadband drops, well Alexa will refuse to reconnect, she just constantly says something along the lines ""i'm struggling to connect at the moment, please check your Internet connection"". The weird thing is the Sonos side works fine and reconnects fine after a drop. E.g. I can play music via the app. You are forced to restart all the speaker everytime the internet drops to rekick in the Alexa integration.2nd. Some features are limited compared to Amazons own devices. E.g. Alexa cant phone people. You can't connect any multirooms with Amazons own alexa devices.3rd. Alexa just randomly does not play music when you ask her to. ""Alexa, play music from Harry's Spotify account"" and then she just stops... Check the Alexa app... and she heard me perfectly and understood (you can see your speech against text on how alexa understood what you asked).Although we have now got to a point where we just don't use Alexa, which isn't a big deal for us but might be for others. All said, Generally Sonos is a fantastic eco system and Sonos Ones don't fall short from what you should expect from the brand.

    Fantastic little speaker, allows use of Alexa without need for Echo or Dot devices.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,"







  
  
    Having taken the plunge to install some smart lights and sockets, when I read about this product it appeared that the Alexa voice component was for use with audio features however it also allows us to use voice control of anything that ""she"" is linked to. Once we had added the Sonos skill to Alexa we did not need the Echo in our kitchen any longer and were able to re-purpose it in another room.The unit itself is very smart, small, satin black plastic in appearance with the metal grill around the middle outer surface. The sound from such a small device is however very clear, crisp and has a surprisingly rich bass to it for the size. At higher volumes it is not as good as the larger Play5 unit but common sense dictates that at the end of the day.Touch controls on the top surface are very easy to use, regardless of how dry, damp or greasy your fingers may be but it would be advisable to only use dry and clean hands to prevent muck being deposited into the ring of very small holes that constitute aperture for the microphone array.When using voice control the speaker can be trained with the Alexa app to better understand a particular user's voice however the generic ""out the box"" settings work perfectly for all my family as none of us have strong regional dialects. I cannot speak for anyone from Newcastle or Glasgow but when I was reading the reviews on this unit on some hifi websites they did state that for such accents the training would be beneficial so that it does not keep moaning about not understanding voice commands. Just be aware that if you put the unit in a corner and run it at anything about about 6/10 on the volume scale then it is likely it will not respond to voice at all as the system will be making so much noise that it may not accurately hear your commands.

    I purchased these cables about 2.5 months ago and have been using them each day. These have been so reliable and I feel very comfortable charging my devices with them.The power delivery is always consistent. Just as advertised. I’ve tested them on different devices, different brand 20 to 45 watt power bricks and the result is always the same. The cord is very stiff right out of the packaging. However after a few months it does lighten up a little. It remains to be a strong heavy duty cord and is not flimsy.These cords have been on several trips and they travel well. I really appreciate the rubber zip tie on the cable. It keeps the cable together in my bag with no problem.You can not beat the quality and price of these cables. You won’t be disappointed!

    Best budget cables I have used
  
",Reviewed in Canada on 15 October 2023,"







  
  
    Used them for over a year every day to charge my iPhone 13 Pro, They do a great job and are able to carry a good wattage to charge the device, there is not even a hint showing that the necks of the cables will start to bend or break because of the rubber reinforcing, however, the rubber cable wrap does rip after a while, not a deal breaker to me since I use reusable velcro straps for them!

    Exceptional Customer Service and Reliable Performance: A Positive Review for Safuel iPhone Cable
  
",Reviewed in the United States on 5 May 2023,"







  
  
    I recently had an issue with the Safuel iPhone cable I purchased, as it arrived in a returned condition and the packaging was damaged. However, I am pleased to say that the customer service team promptly replaced the item for me, and I am now very satisfied with their service.The new Safuel iPhone cable works exactly as described in the ads. It charges my iPhone rapidly, delivering a 50% charge within just 30 minutes. I have tested it multiple times, and it consistently performs well. Moreover, I'm relieved to note that it does not heat up my iPhone anymore, ensuring the safety of my device and its battery.I am genuinely impressed with the level of customer care I received from Safuel. They quickly resolved the issue and provided me with a fully functional replacement. Their responsiveness and dedication to customer satisfaction deserve recognition.Based on my current experience, I am updating my review to a positive one. The Safuel iPhone cable is now performing excellently, and I am happy with its performance. I would gladly recommend it to others, taking into account the exceptional customer service provided by Safuel.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2023,"







  
  
    I've literally just accidently dropped my phone off a balcony. It fell out of my pocket, bounced off the floor, through the bars and dropped quite a distance off the balcony onto a hard floor. Looking down I could see the case had popped off and I was certain it was broken! But surprisingly it was completely fine!! The back part of the case was shattered but the phone its self unharmed!Safe to say I bought a new one straight away!

    Surprisingly Good
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2023,"







  
  
    I was sceptical about this case, but thought I'd try it.  It's actually really good. Seems to provide good, solid protection (I haven't thrown it on the floor to check that out fully myself, but according to other reviews, the case screen will sacrifice itself for the iPhone, so what more can I ask for?). Very nice to hold, light, not bulky at all.  The look is very much similar to getting a normal protective case and putting a separate screen protector on. You honestly cannot tell that this case is a front+back case. Touch screen works perfectly.  Pleasantly surprised, and would recommend.

    damage / dirt
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2023,"







  
  
    I've bought 3 pre-owned from Amazon over the last few years.  This is the first phone that has visible damage to the corner.  The screen and back are free of scratches.The phone also had dirt build up from the previous user's case.  The dirt is around the charging port and the button to turn the sound on/off.I understand the damage to the top corner, it is second hand so can't expect no damage at all.  But I am disappointed that they couldn't have cleaned the dirt off the phone.  I'm wondering whether it's refurbished at all or they just reset the phone and box it for shipping?The other disappointing thing is, I thought it would come with a USB-C charger like all the IPhone 12's do and it didn't.  It's just a regular charging cable, so now I will have to purchase one.I'm still to test it out fully, as will need to check the call quality etc.  Overall the phone looks good, I'm just really disappointed that it wasn't cleaned properly.

    I lost my old phone and needed a new one quickly  This was great value and there the next day, so the replacement was seamless! It does more than I need it to, but I’m sure I’ll grow into it  I’m in my seventies so tech doesn’t come naturally to me. I’ve actually managed to set it up myself, and life goes on.

    If you're swapping from Android and have never had an iPhone, this is the best one for you!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2022,"







  
  
    So, I had just brought this phone a good two months ago and I have never been so pleased with a phone before. I had come from a Samsung S10e and if any of you knew that phone, you would know it is a small and very compact phone. My battery life on the Samsung was really bad, so I had decided to get an iPhone 11. Happy to say that I don't regret buying it.I had got the initial phone for £480 ish as I brought the 128gb version, since I needed the storage. I have barely used half of the storage too, which is good. The battery is actually good, it goes down gradually as the hours pass, but sometimes I notice that if I keep certain apps like Spotify opened up for a long time, the battery tends to go down faster, but that's probably because I have Spotify on 24/7. However, on a normal day, the battery basically lasts for most of the day.I had a hard time trying to adjust to the new phone and its' new functions, but I had quickly gotten used to it as I used it more and more. Obviously this is common knowledge but I don't like that Apple had gotten rid of the earphone jack. That annoyed me. But the sound is amazing on this phone.The camera is pretty decent too, it feels like I have a professional camera in my phone. The camera has many functions to suit different people's needs when it comes to having a camera in their phone. I have taken some really nice shots with my phone, and my friends could not believe that it came from my iPhone.Not going to lie, I used to be a Samsung fanboy, so I would always put Apple down for their phones and say that Samsung was better. However, that is now the contrary. I am absolutely pleased with the phone, and I know everyone hypes up iPhones, and yeah, to an extent, it shouldn't be hyped up that much, but, in my experience, this is a rock solid phone and I recommend buying it if you can't afford the more newer phones, as it essentially has all of the functions the newer phones have. Additionally, the iPhone 11 will be updated for more years, so that's even more of a reason to buy this phone.

    Wouldn't pay the silly price of the most up to date iphones but they are good so always upgrade to a reasonable price older model. The iphone 11 is fine for most users and the battery life is far better than my older model.

    Bought as Excellent but Battery Health 78% Returned
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2022,"







  
  
    Ordered for a Christmas present, read through the Amazon renew guarantee of all items inspected and graded and all grades have a battery capacity of greater than 80% so I ordered the excellent condition 64GB version and the seller was Plunc Tech, I even read the reviews on the seller and nothing was sticking out from the feedback.Item arrived in plain packaging with a charger and charging lead and sim tool, it was well packaged, took the phone out screen had a crusty blob of what looked like food, but came off, no dents or scratches on the casing and only a few hairline scratches on the screen, charged it up, set it up and went to battery health and was gutted to see the batter capacity was only 78% to say I was peed off is an understatement.Contacted Amazon and they were very apologetic and asked if I wanted to contact the seller first, I agreed and the seller said all the usual about how all phones are checked and fully refurbished before being sent out, however this wasn’t my experience. They sent me a Royal Mail return label just as they was going on strike so posted on Tuesday and wasn’t delivered until the Monday, I was hoping for a replacement or at least a new battery, and when I contacted them today asking for the options, the reply was we’ve refunded you, now the earliest I can get a replacement is Christmas Eve I would have rather had this phone’s battery replaced even if it didn’t arrive in time for Christmas so I new that I’d have a nice phone with great battery.Now I’ve reordered from a different company and im now playing Russian roulette hoping the battery is decent and not a duff, Apple considers batteries of less than 80% as needing replacement.The Amazon renewed guarantee is great though and customer service are really helpful and explained that anything your not happy with within 12 months you can return or replace, it was just unfortunate that this happened at Christmas timeUpdate: Second iphone arrived this time only 81% battery, as this is supposed to be a phone in excellent condition I’m not that happy as this battery will need replacing within a year, so another returned iPhone, im not being picky I just want something that will last at least 12 months without any issues and the battery is the main issue, phones described as excellent, good or acceptable should be based on the health of the battery, if I ordered a phone in an acceptable condition then I’d be ok with this, but paying a premium for excellent condition, this just isn’t good enough

    This is the 2nd phone I have bought from this seller. This time I got an ‘acceptable’ condition one. I can’t see the difference from this to the ‘excellent’ one I bought the other week. Battery is 85% which is fine, I bought this as I wanted to return to iPhone but didn’t want to pay the cost. Would recommend 100%

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    Other than the fact I received a Chinese model the phone works well and has good battery life. BUT the main reason I’m returning this or hopefully exchanging (if possible) is because Chinese models of iPhone does not allow FaceTime audio calling.

Apple iPhone 13 is so easy to use with a lot of protection from Apple them selves. So I'm very happy with this phone. Also comes with a 12 months Amazon warranty.

It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days.

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days.

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    Very nice case, well worth the money
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    So I discovered Casekoo on YouTube, started using a black translucent one on my iPhone 14 pro max, after trying 3 other brands(spigen was one of them), sent them all back for various reasons, then got the Casekoo case and I liked it so much I kept it on the phone for 6months until I upgraded to my 15 pro max, I had to have another for my new phone, so I went with the blue one to match my blue 15 pro max, it really does compliment the phone well.What I like most about the case is the fact that it’s very good value for money, was £16.99 at the time of writing this review, which I think is very good, as the case feels premium and well made, really soft and comfortable to hold, and I’ve noticed with this version they’ve added a slightly textured surface to the sides, to aid grip, the sides were just smooth on the 14 pro max version I bought 6/7 months ago, so that’s a nice change too. Obviously all the ports are perfectly cut out, and buttons very clicky and responsive. The raised camera bump is generous too, to protect the camera lens when laying the phone down. For me it strikes a good balance of being drop protective, but not too bulky, and without adding too much weight to the phone.Overall I can highly recommended casekoo

    ""Maximum Protection, Minimal Bulk - CASEKOO Armor Shockproof Delivers!""
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2023,"







  
  
    I recently acquired an iPhone 15, and my priority was to find a case that could offer superior protection without compromising the phone's sleek design. The CASEKOO Armor Shockproof for iPhone 15 proved to be the perfect choice, striking a balance between robust defense and a slim profile.First and foremost, the matte finish gives it a classy and premium look. The black color adds a touch of sophistication, and it's resistant to fingerprints, so my phone always looks pristine. The slim design doesn't add unnecessary bulk to my iPhone 15, which is something I truly appreciate.The standout feature of this case is its military-grade protection. It's built to withstand a 10-foot drop, providing me with unparalleled peace of mind. The corners have extra reinforcement, which is where most impact occurs during drops. This case can take a hit and protect my iPhone 15 flawlessly.Moreover, the non-slip texture is fantastic. It ensures a secure grip in my hand, preventing accidental drops. The precise cutouts for ports and buttons make it a breeze to access all the features of my iPhone 15. The tactile buttons feel responsive and easy to use.The raised edges around the camera and screen provide an added layer of protection, preventing scratches and dings when I place my phone face-down. This attention to detail shows that CASEKOO has thought of everything.Installation was a breeze, and the slim design makes it easy to slide my iPhone 15 in and out of my pocket without any hassle.In conclusion, the CASEKOO Armor Shockproof for iPhone 15 Case is the ideal combination of style and protection. It offers military-grade defense against drops and accidents while maintaining a sleek and elegant appearance. If you're looking for a case that can handle the toughest situations without sacrificing aesthetics, this is the one. I highly recommend it to anyone with an iPhone 15.

    Case fits very snug and gives protection o the camera very well. Has a small lip on the front o protect the front screen when placed on its face. Comes with a free phone stand which I didn’t realise I needed until I used it and that’s just a lovely touch. Furthermore, it comes with a load of free stickers! Who doesn’t love free stickers

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2023,"







  
  
    I recently purchased this for my iPhone 15 Pro and once again, I'm thoroughly impressed with their product. Not only does it fit my phone perfectly, but it also adds a touch of elegance to its appearance.One of the delightful surprises with this purchase was the inclusion of a free stand and stickers. The stand is incredibly useful for hands-free video calls and media viewing, making it a valuable addition to the package. The stickers offer a fun and personalized touch for my case.I've been a loyal Casekoo customer for some time now, and their consistent quality never disappoints. This case is another testament to their commitment to producing top-notch phone accessories. If you're looking for a reliable, stylish, and functional phone case that doesn’t cost silly money, Casekoo should be your go-to choice.

    Pretty Nice Case
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2023,"







  
  
    This is a decent case for the iPhone 15 Pro. In theory, it should support the earlier models with the same form factor, but the 15 has more rounded corners.The case is snug, but easy to install and remove without too much flexing.  The cut-outs for the camera and the side buttons line up perfectly. The case sits comfortably in the hand and is easy to grip without too much pressure.All told, a nice case

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2023,"







  
  
    I install screen protectors on every single one of my phones and always take great care. I never have any issues, however experienced bubbling issues with these screen protectors. I had to completely disregard the first protector, and currently am using the second one with minor bubbles. Also the guide isn’t helpful and applies the protector in the wrong place, so use the guide stickers and do it yourself.

    I like the case, it fits IPhone 15 perfect and feels sturdy.However, one of the main selling points for me was the transparent back, this is definitely not the case it’s more tinted. You cannot see the Apple badge and it looks like I just have a black case. I was hoping to feel more like not having a case.

    Dissatisfied, comfort issues
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 October 2023,"







  
  
    I am dissatisfied with this purchase. Whilst the case seems to be made of decent quality materials, it does not fit iPhone 15 pro well.My biggest complaint is that the phone sits too deep in the case so the case edges stick out too far which makes corner-swipe gestures a lot more difficult to perform. When the phone is held in one hand such swiping becomes even harder.My second complaint is that the new iPhone 15 series side button is barely reachable. My fingers are relatively thin, but I can press the button only using my index finger nail (with some effort!)The third complaint is that the magnetic lock on the side may become an issue because it is quite hard and stick out far enough to cause discomfort, particularly when the phone is held in one hand.As I said in the beginning of this review, I like the materials and design of the case, but the fit issues are annoying.Hopefully, this review will be seen and considered by the manufacturer with a view on improving this product.

    I had one before or the iPhone 13. This product is really well made and a perfect fit to the phone. I have one reservation. The magnetic clips are nowhere near as powerful as the one I bought for my other phone I attempted to put more than three cards  impossible to stay closed, but even with three cards in it, has trouble staying together. I did a quick comparison with both cases old and new and definitely the magnets in the new are not anywhere near as powerfulI wish Torro would put longer tabs for the magnets to allow more cards

    It’s very nice leather case good quality but pretty useless on iPhone pro 15 it does not fit properly.It’s virtually impossible to use the action button because it sits too far back from the case all other buttons are fine, but being this is an action button and most used on the phone it makes this case a waste of time so really not worth buying! Mine is just in the cupboard after 2 days use it’s total waste of timeIf you don’t mind that it’s a nice case!

    This is my 2nd Torro case. The first one lasted really well for the 2 years I had my last phone until the upgrade. I've decided to get the exact same case in a lighter colour because it was so excellent.My old phone was immaculate when I removed it form the old case, and it had been dropped a lot, so that's a testament to the protection you get from these cases.

    The Apple iPhone 14 Pro is a definite winner.Its very easy to set up and data can be transferred from your old phone seamlessly.The toughened glass frame feels solid in your hand and the corners are nicely rounded.The bionic chip that operates the phone is slick and much faster than its predecessor.Download times are improved also.There is a definite improvement to the 3 way camera feature and your photos show a notable pixel increase.Its marginally heavier than the 13pro and feels positive when held.There is also an improvement in daylight glare which is useful in direct sunlight.I can thoroughly recommend the 6.1 inch screen and am really pleased with my purchase.

    Great phone! Better than average battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2023,"







  
  
    I upgraded from a six-year-old iPhone 8. So I can see the evolutionary developments in this phone. It’s solid, heavy and built like a tank. Very fast processing and an amazing camera. I was slightly disappointed with the battery, however. My old phone would drop to 20% by mid afternoon and this one drops to the same level by mid evening. So it needed a top up. I was hoping for it to last longer. But overall I am happy with the phone. I’m sure there are some ‘tips and tricks’ online to make the battery last longer!

    Replacement for an iPhone X
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2023,"







  
  
    This was a researched purchase on price features benefit and most importantly reliability. The phone is similar size to the X but with faster processor it has the 256 G memory performance is extremely fast.The case alone cost £20 and it’s worth the money.Very impressive resolution watching video and photos. The speaker is sound has a lot more clarity and the sound is pretty much similar to the X.I’m very pleased with it though it is expensive I guess you get what you pay for.

    Man, oh man, was für eine gute Qualität. Meine Vorstellungen wurden noch übertroffen. Es passt und stimmt alles rundherum. Hatte vorher ein Huawei, das bedeutet auch eine gewisse Zeit der Umstellung. Die Fotoleistung des Huawei war auch sehr gut, da kommt das iPhone mit. Vor allem hilft mir das iPhone beim Telefonieren, da nun die Gespräche vom IPhone auf die Hörgeräte per Bluetooth übertragen werden in einer hervorragenden Sprachqualität. Na ja, der Preis ist natürlich auch gewaltig, aber bis jetzt habe ich den Kauf nicht bereut und es steckt ja auch sehr viel Leistung dahinter. Wer es finanziell kann, sollte es sich kaufen.

Unfortunately although this phone was great with its features and performance as a phone it did not work as a rugged phone as it fell from my son’s pocket on to the floor and the screen smashed despite it being well under the 1.5 metres it’s meant to withstand. It was returned and the seller refunded straight away with no issues.

     This is an awesome mobile phone at a great price. Set up for super easy as the phone gave me an option to transfer over all of my info from my old android smartphone. The screen is good and plenty of RAM and storage. I've enjoyed music, video, and web surfing on it and works very well, used it outside the house in a recreation center with WiFi and it handled itself admirably. The screen is gorgeous. I watch my movies on the phone and they look really good.

    I was more than happy with the quality of the product.The phone arrived promptly and in my opinion very well packaged.It's a great phone that has as many functions as the more expensive phones, and it has an extremely powerful camera with 108mp. The 13,000 mAh big battery adopts advanced dual-cell technology, which is safer and more stable in use and has a longer standby time.Overall a great product for the price.

     Because the screen of my mobile phone was broken, it was no longer usable, so I needed to buy a new mobile phone. After comparison and further selection, I chose this mobile phone with a strong design. After receiving it, I was shocked by its appearance, solid  The casing has a large memory and is relatively smooth to use. There is no lag at all when browsing the web. The battery capacity is very large. In normal use, even after three days of use, there is still 20% of the remaining power. It is very suitable for me to work outdoors without worrying about power.  and the photos taken by the camera are very clear, which is unexpected. In short, this is a mobile phone that I am satisfied with, and I hope to use it for a long time.

     I was looking for a smartphone, but I have to say that they are quite expensive. I was very pleased to find this one which I find comparable to a name brand phone and even better and someways at a fraction of the cost. This smartphone has a lot of memory up to 256 GB of ROM and 14 GB of RAM. I like that you can also expand it up to 1 TB if you use a TF card. This is a rugged phone. It feels like it has a case on it already because it is very thick and it is IP 68 waterproof as well. It also has dustproof and drop-proof resistance to it to you. This has a 5,000 MAH battery so I can get up to 16 hours of constant use before it needs to be recharged. It even has a cool built-in light in the back with different functions like SOS and adjustable brightness. This phone comes with some built-in apps and it’s very easy to navigate. I like how user-friendly it is as well, and once I hooked up my information in the play store, I can download anything I wanted. Love it!

The display and colors are very rich and vivid, even at the slightly lower actual resolution. Media consumption has been good, playback of video and audio is solid, whether streaming or using local media from the home server. This is a great phone, responsive, easy to set up with either android or iphone, camera results better than expected.

    My first impression is that its a substantial phoneOn switching on for the first time one is prompted to select a language . It's easy to change from the default English USA to English UKYou then insert your SIM card(s) or you can skip this and connect to your wi-fi this may take a few minutes to get the phone readyOn completion you are offered the option to copy apps and data from another device. this can copy apps, photos, contacts google accounts etcThis can be done wirelessly if you don't have a double ended cable. You open the Google app on your old device and tap set up new deviceAfter a minute or two one can then choose what to copyAllow a few minutes for thisYou can  choose  between Gestural or button navigation. It's easy to switch back later if you change your mindA search engine can be selected then a PIN, the fingerprint sensor takes a few minutes to set up but it's progress can easily be followednext you can unlock your face this can be set to work with eyes openNext are Vision SettingsDisplay size and text where one can easily adjust the font and display size by means of a sliderthen set the magnification option this enables one to quickly zoom in and out on screen using two fingersThen there is a screen reader for those with visual impairment it reads the screen out loud with the powerful speaker on the rear. To force a restart hold the power button for 10 seconds or soI have dealt with Blackview previously and can confirm they are always to help if necessary

    I received this on the 13 Aug but only started transferring over three days ago. Yes it's a tank of a phone but for the price, specs & storage, I can't complain. A week's worth of researching, I don't regret buying it,Yes it's heavy but using it for 4 hours on a draining app only used 6% battery, the screen is a fantastic size at 6.70 inch and brilliant colour.I can't afford the slimline ranges at over £1000, just can't/won't justify the purchase, not even the other budget Chinese phones.The UI is friendly after a few niggles as no instructions came with it.Huge 256gb storage & can add 1TB SD card for extra storage 12gb RAM.It's a winner for me.Holding the phone will be my gym workout.No extras come with it, the case is rugged enough to withstand an accident of not Battery life is awesome, a whole day used 10% plus with 33w charging it's full on less than 10mins.Camera leaves much to be desired but got over that using G Cam.Stereo speakers✅6.70 inch screen ✅Battery life 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟UI mostly customisable ⭐⭐⭐⭐This is one serious phone but not for aesthetics.I'm totally in love with this BV9300.Goodbye samsung, Huawei and the rest.Update 23 Aug, sim tray broke, how in the living hell did they design a stupid hinge of all the blasted things, for a sim tray? I'm livid.UPDATE :There's a problem, phone crashed and display greyscale, support informed a motherboard problem.If there's s problem why is this not communicated?

    The phone is very good.  I want to highlight some points in particular: 1. the screen - despite the fact that it is IPS, it is better than my old Amoled.  Everything is very clearly visible on it and it works very quickly.  2. Battery: this is my salvation.  I use it for two days, considering my work in delivery and the constant use of navigation, I charge the phone 1 time in two days.  An ordinary person will have enough charging for three or four days.  3. This is a phone case.  it really feels like a good device in your hand.  Before that, I used Samsung Note 10 and give preference to this phone.  4. Last but not least, this is the attitude of the Blackview support team: they respond quickly, professionally and humanely treat customers and their wishes.  This is great service and real customer care.  Bottom line: I advise you to enter into a deal with this seller and get this wonderful phone.

     It's worth saying firstly that these phones are bigger than the average phone so as long as you don't mind a bit of extra bulk on your phone then this device is absolutely brilliant.The BV9300 from Blackview has an amazing spec, very large battery and is housed in a rugged designed case that gives it top end drop protection, dust and waterproof protection. The screen is a 6.7"" 120Hz FHD display, it has a 50MP rear camera and 32MP selfie camera, it takes two 4G sim cards and it runs Android 12 which means it has compatibility with almost any application.Spec is great with 21GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. You can expand the storage up to 1TB with a TF card if required, although I doubt I'll need to do so. The battery is 15080mAh which is more than triple the last iPhone capacity and lasts for a long time.These phones are as good as any top end smart phone and a fraction of the price, the only downside is they are bigger, heavier and chunkier.

     I wanted to replace my old phone that had cracked screen. This  rugged smartphone was reasonably priced and an high spec Android so it was perfect choice .The phone is very solidly constructed. The graphics are above average and the screen brightness is very good I'm still getting acquainted with the menu, but so far  It responds well to whatever I ask it to do. This device has many useful features and I have taken advantage of the ability to add it to my phone account so I can use it to process credit cards payments.  Everything is working well so far. All apps works smoothly. It was just what I was looking for.

If you don't need a posing all singing and dancing mobile this is ideal, speed is very good and a very decent camera, and a two year guarantee. Well done Blackview.

    this is my first EVER smartphone (bought because the world has adopted a system that says, if you want to use the net for ANY transaction, you HAVE to have a mobile for verification purposes!! - insane as far as im concerned, but there you go)so i tried to find the best of all features with the best price (quite a search i can tell you)and so far there are more negatives than positives, first of which is the massive LACK of guidance with this thing - literally nothing but the very basic manual to show you the main features and thats it, and for a proper noob like ME, thats an issue!then theres things like facial and thumbprint verification and as far as i can tell, they just arent there (it might be me being stupid or something, but i simply cannot find them on the device)BUT, for a TINY little thing that can sit in your pocket, get access to the net, emails, take stunning photos, allow passcodes and verification purposes for the PRICE it IS, brand NEW, it does kinda work!

     Try and move away from the ridiculously overpriced branded mobile phones that are currently on the market so I decided to go with a well known brand but one that didn't cost the earth.This phone in particular has amazing specs with 7 gigabytes of ram as well as 32 gigabytes of storage which is expandable up to one terabyte, it runs on Android 12 which means it's completely updated and is able to run most of the more recent apps that are available through the play store. It has an oversized battery over 5000mAh which is easily enough to be able to run for a full day without needing to be recharged however it comes with the fast charger itself as well so even if you do need to top it up it doesn't take too long.The screen itself takes up almost the front of the phone so there's hardly any borders meaning you'll get a nice visual experience when playing games or even streaming films online. Apart from all of the specs it simply works so you will be able to run all of the apps that you think you should be able to run as well as having battery that will last for enough time during the day and just have a phone that does what it should do.

    A Few Issues
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2023,"







  
  
    The main issue is if you're scrolling to the left and do it too fast you knock off the page, very annoying. The phone is good but you're probably better off with a better brand. Also changing your phone is a stressfull operation, getting your apps back can be a night mare. A few things aren't working properly on this phone, especially emails from Apps to change passwords. I'm not getting at all. Camera is very good. When you set screen timer on for 30 mins, it goes back to 5seconds the next day.

    Great specs for the price you pay. The phone is easy to hold on to and has a nice feeling to it. The camera quality is good. Surprised by the features it has at this value. The phone is fast and reliable with the included 7 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage you can have lots of apps and photos on it with no problem. Battery life is pretty decent and did last me a whole day with good browsing 1 full-length movie streaming and a couple of hours of calls. So, is a great budget mobile phone.

     I recently upgraded to the Blackview A53 and it's been a game-changer. With my old phone, I was constantly running out of storage and missing out on important calls due to a single SIM slot. The A53's 3 card slots and massive 1TB storage ensure I never have to worry about that again. Plus, the 5080mAh battery keeps me going all day. The only downside? My friends now want to borrow my charger constantly!

    Doesn't support instagram
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2023,"







  
  
    The phone itself was nice. Good size, decent photo's, but was a bit slow to respond. I don't use Instagram much, only occasionally but would have been nice if blackview stated that the phone doesn't support Instagram in the info section. Price wise it's value for money if you just want to use the phone for basic use

    Renewed - not quite in Excellent Condition
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2023,"







  
  
    Condition:Bought the 13 Max Pro 1TB renewed in Excellent Condition from PixelDirect. Unfortunately there was a small scratch on the screen, and there are plenty of marks on the body. This goes counter to what Excellent Condition should be! I was hoping for much better. Battery was 90% which isn't too bad.Size:It's big but not so big as to make it unusable most of the time. I've quickly gotten used to it from my 6S. It has some heft to it and feels solid.Usage:It's fast and nippy loading apps and moving between them, and the screen is great to look at. The camera take some getting used to, but it's producing good photos so far. It does, however, take ages to charge. The seller enclosed a 10W charger - not great as this will take around six hours for the phone to charge, if I remember correctly. Ok if you charge it overnight. The phone itself can draw around 27W, so buy yourself a 30W charger to get the most out of its fast charge ability and hit 100% in 1.5 hours.

    Was OK BUT...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2023,"







  
  
    The phone was OK - too slow - but I think I had a dodgy one! However the biggest issue was the iPhone seemed to have 3 months less (Apple) warranty on it although I bought this brand new? Amazon tried reassuring me that it was covered by their warranty, but you pay Apple prices you want the Apple service in their stores. Very confusing, so I thought I'd return it as the easiest option. Only issue is now over 2 weeks gone and no refund...

    Can’t get the iPhone 13 Pro Max new now, so decided to use this site. First time I’ve purchased a second hand Apple product. Phone is immaculate. Does have 89% battery life but overall condition exceptional. Charging lead supplied too. Delivery time a couple of days slower than advised but my location is more challenging. Most importantly though really pleased with this phone. Was advised ‘excellent condition’ and it is 😊. A few people commented on packaging - mine was simple and not bulky but strong. I’m converted I think - may now keep going with pre-loved Apple goods as so pleased with this one. Thank you

    This phone is fantastic, the Iphone 13 pro max followed on from the 12 pro max and was even better. I am one of those people who always gets the newest iphone every year from apple. But for my mother, a phone this high spec for this price was a steal. Iphones agae well and pro models last a long time. With I don't notice the upgrade only having a phone for a year then upgrading, but considering this model was around £1,500 when it came out, and we are only up to the 15 coming out next month, the price job I think is fantastic, yes its refurbished  but its to a high standard, or at least the one I got was. Not a scratch on it, and the battery life is fantastic. This is the perfect option for people who can't afford the latest phone as it comes out and waiting a year and abit, theres a massive price drop for a quality phone.

    I bought one that was very good condition, but I had to exchange it for a pro max one. Then the second was horrible, a lot of scratches on the screen and the back of the phone as well (camera part). then I needed get a refund for that. I've sent it by post and I am expecting the money back.

    I needed to replace an iPhone 6s Plus but didn’t want to pay Apple approximately a £1000 for their latest model.  This is two models back but works brilliantly and was considerably better value.  Time will tell whether it will last as long as my iPhone 6 but at least this phone is covered with a 12 month warranty so fingers crossed

    The phone outer look was so good to say it closer to a brand new iPhone. I was given with a battery of 81% which is very much to be considered as not suitable to use and has to be replaced. The battery cost change might eat up another £100 which should have been considered in the price. However, I had now used for a month time and the phone seems to be good so far.Other than the battery and it’s capacity, the phone is good and I suggest this for other as well.

    Seems a good phone so far, but the delivery…
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2023,"







  
  
    I, like everyone else considering this product, was a bit wary of ordering a renewed phone instead of a new one, without seeing it first anyway. However, upon arrival & first look the phone is in impeccable condition! Everything seems to work as it should and the screen, edges, cameras etc are all free from any signs of use. I do however have two criticisms. The first, is that the battery health is only at 83%. My old iPhone is better than that at around 91/92! Still, it’s a second hand phone and it works. It’s really not the end of the world. It does it’s job and seems fine.My main issue was the delivery. When I heard that the phone was being sent through Evri my heart sank. I’ve lost so many parcels with them lately, this is actually the first parcel I’ve ever had arrive in one piece from them. The parcel was lost, then turned up again, then lost again, delayed, and finally arrived a week after it was due and then thrown over my 6ft garden fence. Luckily however, the phone is in one piece. I would just urge the seller to reconsider who they are using to send these devices.I would gladly buy another device from this company when the time comes, but not if Evri are taking anything to do with it.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2023,"







  
  
    I am very pleased with the appearance of my new phone. Despite buying a refurbished device, it arrived without any noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. There were some small scuffs on the stainless steel band, but they were not too noticeable and did not cause any discomfort during use. I was impressed with the overall condition of the phone, indicating that the previous owner took good care of it. Upon testing all of its features, I found that they were all in good working order. However, I was a bit disappointed with the battery life. The battery health was only 84%, which is lower than I expected. Upon further investigation, I found that the phone had lost over 800mAh of its battery capacity and had gone through over 700 charge cycles. Given these factors, I would have preferred if the battery was replaced. Despite this, I am happy with the functioning of all the other features of the phone.

    Bought as a gift and I was skeptic all to begin with without actually seeing the item first but so glad I ordered it, it’s excellent the battery life is amazing and the body of the phone too. The screen has some usual wear but that’s to be expected and nothing noticeable you have to really look at it in certain lighting to see properly. Had it almost a month now and no issues up to now. Would recommend as it’s a great price as well and well worth it.

    Virtually as new iPhone at a great price
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2021,"







  
  
    I already have one of these which I bought second hand last year and cost about £285. These are a real bangs for bucks modern iPhone that can still be bought new from Apple for £500. This one from Amazon renewed was for my Father-in-Law. At the same price and only 6 months after buying my own this is a great deal considering the guarantee. As long as you’re not too bothered about the lack of original box and accessories there’s a lot to like. For a start the battery health was showing 97% which is great. My own XR has 89% and still easily gets through a day. The back glass and front screen were perfect and completely unmarked. I did find a couple of very minor scuffs on the mid frame. I queried these with the seller because the description says the phone should look ‘as new’ from 30 cm, which I thought was over egging it. I requested a part refund to the pre price increase cost of £256 which was agreed. The marks were super minor so I would say at half the new cost for an XR this is exceptional valueEverything works properly on this iPhone and the only set up issue was that the seller had already done a base set up and had incorrectly set the country to USA not UK. Consequently when we tried to set up Siri we were offered US voices and the weather app tried to give us local weather stateside. Once we started from scratch and reset all settings selecting UK as the country everything went smoothly and the set up was completed FaceID working correctly iCloud signed in etc. So all in all a good buy and the cheapest way to get a relatively up to date virtually as new iPhone with some peace of mind

    Great mid tier iPhone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2021,"







  
  
    I had a 2016 iPhone SE which had battery problems. I had to charge it so often it was hard to do anything with it.I wanted a second hand phone that was still being sold on apple website and found this XR on Amazon resell website. It’s a 128GB phone and it came with a 88% battery health. At £298, it was a bargain and has been working superbly for the last month I have had it.I would rate it as excellent value for money and because it’s still being sold on apple store, I know it will have support for a lot of years to come.It can however lag on some power hungry games, but that’s a minor thing, because I am not a big gamer anyway. Coming from a phone with a physical home button to an all screen one has been a learning curve. As good as face recognition is, you always have to pick up the phone or angle your face right for it to unlock. This can become annoying when you have your phone on the desk/table and need to unlock it. With the home button, you just had to place your finger on the button and voila! This is literally a minor issue. It’s kinda like going from a manual car to an auto. The experience will be different but either has its own pros and cons.

    Poor quality control, fake display, poor battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2022,"







  
  
    The product came in absolute pristine conditions, as advertised. No problems in that regard. But the very moment I turned on the phone, I realised that the screen is very pixelated and shows colour fringing around the letters (purple borders on black text on a white background) and I immediately knew something was wrong. As soon as I finish setting up the phone, I get a notification from the phone itself that the screen is not original and it may cause issues. I wouldn't recommend paying this much for an iPhone Pro, renowned for its display quality, if it comes with a non-Apple, low quality display!UPDATE: I decided to order a replacement. This time the iPhone they sent wouldn't even turn on. Whereas the customer team seemed to do everything they could to help, I guess it all comes down to the very poor quality control team, which doesn't even check whether the phone they're sending off even switches on.UPDATE2: I ordered a THIRD replacement and as expected, the third one came with the same issues. The battery was at 80% (1% away from needing to be replaced) and the screen was a low resolution, non-original Apple screen, same as the first phone I returned. The team really doesn't seem to care to send genuine Apple parts with the iPhone, so I would seriously recommend against buying this phone. You don't buy an iPhone for the Apple logo, but for the quality of the components inside! If they're not genuine (especially something as important as the screen), then it's not worth your money.DO NOT BUY

    When I read a previous review about this seller's item, two things that were mentioned caught my attention and that was that a buyer received his Iphone 11 Pro in pristine condition with a 100% battery health. I had hoped that I might get the same but did not expect I would. The delivery came a day earlier than stated and the phone was indeed pristine and with 100% battery health. Helpfully, it also comes with a good screen protector already installed. It could pass as a brand new phone.I'm very impressed with this as i've never bought a renewed phone from via Amazon before.I would have no hesitation to use this seller again.

Battery manages to survive excellently well despite very heavy usage ( I use my phone for everything online - emails, texts, apps, etc).Was wary about ordering a renewed phone but very happy with this. Not a single sign of wear/scuffs etc. Visually perfect. Would recommend

    After just six months this phone started running out of juice, I don't normally notice this for a year or so with iPhones and I bought it rather than the 12 or 14 because it was meant to have better battery life... It is still a great phone though.

    Absolutely love this MacBook Air, looks great and quality so much better than previous laptop which cost around the same initial price new. Charger unfortunately didn't work but customer service was very prompt and responsive in dealing with this and a replacement arrived next day. My first MacBook but I am totally converted and at a price that I can afford.

    The device itself is speedy small and compact it’s brilliant for office use and other tasks such as Netflix and Spotify. The screen quality is outstanding and the Touch ID function saves time when entering passwords. One small issue I faced was that the device itself is 2018 not 2019 as advertised and also arrived with a dent in the bottom of the casing however as this does not affect performance And the device is refurbished I’m more than happy to carry on and ignore this.If you’re after a:CompactHigh quality screen and sound systemLong lasting batteryBrilliant operating systemThen I’d really recommend!Order arrived very quickly with a charging cable and instructions.

    One of my favorite all-time laptops and a pleasure to use.  The keyboard is my all-time favorite: light touch, sensitive and responsive with absolutely no noticeable lag.  The screen which is amazing; sharp, bright and does not cause any eye strain, while the battery lasts quite long.Upgraded from an Intel based Macbook Pro with 16Gb RAM and the only feature I miss is the touch bar.  So far I haven't experienced any noticeable performance degradation even though this has only 8Gb RAM compared to my other macbook however I do recommend the 16GB variant rather than the 8Gb for 'future-proof' because the memory is unified (cannot be upgraded).Amazing laptop!

    The 2022 Apple MacBook Air, powered by the M2 chip, is an absolute game-changer in the world of laptops. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is breathtaking, offering crisp, vivid visuals. With 8GB of RAM and a 256GB drive, it's the perfect blend of performance and storage for my needs. The MacBook Air's sleek design, lightweight build, and silent operation are impressive. It's blazing-fast and versatile, making it a dream for both work and play. If you're seeking a laptop that embodies the future of technology, look no further. Apple's 2022 MacBook Air is a triumph, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 September 2023,"







  
  
    Apple have stiffed us again on memory and storage. Get the entry level Mac or sell all your organs and your first born to get a more ‘Future Proofed’ one. I need my organs and my first born was having none of it, so I got the entry level one. Software has taken up most of the internal storage, so external SSD drives are an essential. I hate Apples cloud service, it always wants to be uploading or downloading a different file to the one I am trying to use, so I save a lot to external drives. I’m not a fan of track pads, never have been it’s not just a snipe at Apple, so I have a Magic Mouse 2 as well. That combo works great for me. Okay, complaining out of the way. The build quality is insane. The battery life is amazing. The onboard sound is really quite good. The screen looks great, but likes to dim itself from time to time, probably a setting I haven’t got right yet. The keyboard feels nice and positive, with a subtle backlight that helps a lot. Finger print login speeds things up nicely. Close the lid and it goes into standby, which is useful. Magnetic charging port stops it from being dragged off the desk by mistake, it simply disconnects from the Mac instead of dragging it to it’s doom. I’ve had no issues with overheating, it’s cooled through the case without fans. The lack of fans means that it is silent in operation, important stuff like watching shows at four in the morning with your earbuds, while a loved one snores obliviously on beside you. Like I said, I love this Mac I just wish it had more storage and ram at this price point.

    This is our second Macbook Air M2 in our household, both are used by our daughters (GCSE and A Levels).They both replaced their windows laptops. They were getting very slow and noisy.Now, let's talk about the Macbook Air M2 screen. Oh, the screen! It's like a visual feast. The retina display makes everything look stunning. The colours are so vibrant, and the text is incredibly sharp. It's a joy for the eyes.The second thing you notice is how incredibly quiet this Macbook is - there is no cooling fan. Complete silence. It's like a stealthy work companion that never interrupts your focus. Perfect for those long study sessions.And let's not forget the keyboard. It's hard to describe how satisfying it is to type on this laptop. The keys are responsive, and they feel so comfortable.This laptop is worth every penny.

    Truly lightweight and portable - ideal if you have issues with wonky hands
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2022,"







  
  
    I am very pleased with this purchase. I usually have to sit up at a desk and use my iMac but, with a few health problems, this isn't always possible. I am a Logic Pro X hobbyist and, if I'm stuck in bed, or on the sofa, feeling a bit meh, it's not always possible to bash a few tracks together when inspiration strikes.I installed it last night, and it runs like a dream. I'm not a proper producer so I don't want to try to sell it as great for the real musicians out there, it works fast enough for me which was the important thing.It is very light to carry, which is important to me as I have somewhat wonky hands. It also has a lovely magnetic charger so it can't get yanked off a table by a passing cat and I know they are planning it because, well, cats.The keyboard is great! I was expecting to be fumbling a bit moving from one keyboard to another. Usually I'm mashing letters and my touch-typing goes completely awry, but this was seemless between an Apple Magic fullsize keyboard and this gorgeous gold (starlight colour if we're being proper) Macbook Air.I've not checked the battery life yet but if I can edit this later I will add that in.The sound is not awesome because it's a laptop and they are never awesome. I expect it's fine for a YouTube video but not so much for my intended usage. However, I plugged in a set of headphones and I now have no complaints about the audio quality being piped into those in the most glorious manner. As I generally prefer headphones than external sound, I am not bothered but others might want to take this on board. You are not going to manage a party using this as your soundsystem unless you plug something into the headphone socket or have bluetooth speakers etc.Personally I think the screen/colours/clarity is perfectly adequate, but I'm getting on in years , eyesight not great, and I don't edit video or images. I can't review how well that would work as I'm really not looking at much on it beyond YouTube or Logic.It feels speedy. It boots very quickly and there's no delay in opening apps. Yet. I suspect if I make a large piece of music it may struggle slightly opening that up to edit. I say this because my 32GB Ram iMac struggles a bit sometimes and this is only 8GB. I am not a heavy user with a million tabs open and several apps at once so your mileage may (will) vary.It was faster to order this from Amazon than it would have been from the official Apple site. I recall being very impatient waiting for what seemed like forever for my iMac to arrive.All in all, I am delighted with this. It's made my life easier already. It is super fast for what it's got under the bonnet. Sure, there are better Macbooks out there - depending on what you want to do with them -  but, for the cost, and what I need it for, it's perfect for my needs.

    I’ve always owned an iPhone and iPad for general day to day computing, but for anything major or needing to be sat down for any period, I’ve always used a windows computer. I used to build them with the help of my son in law and repair them, but there comes a time when I couldn’t keep switching from iOS to windows and visa versa, and my trusty windows laptop finally failed and it was time to upgrade to a Mac. It wasn’t too difficult to get to grips with the different operating system, seeing as it’s very similar to iOS.The whole machine is very well laid out, the keys are responsive and light, but the track pad has taken a while to get used to, and it’s totally different to a normal windows laptop. Ie mainly the hard push click rather than a light tap, two or three fingers to move the page up and down and shift between windows. Mind you there are plenty of online instructions on how to use it, along with a ‘how to use’ program on the laptop to study at your own pace.What also struck me, was how everything opens up so fast, apps, programs, web pages etc, as soon as you click on them it’s there, no computer thinking about it, no pinwheels, even films load and play straight away, even from an outside source like a flash drive.The magnetic charging lead if a novel idea, and extremely useful if you forget that you have it on charge and just walk away with it, I use these magnetic chargers a lot with my iPhone and iPad, saves a fortune in cables.The laptop is very lightweight and I’m finding that I’m using it more than my iPad now, as it fits neatly in your hand or on a tray while sitting down in your armchair.The only feature I do miss is the lack of a dvd drive, but as I already had a external drive, I found with the help of a USB C hub I’ve been able to bring it back into use, when required, along with a Bluetooth mouse, card reader etc.The colours are crisp and clear with the 1080p liquid retina screen, sound is the same on the 4 speaker system, when playing films and music.Battery life is huge, up to 18 hours, obviously it does depend on what your doing. Charging is super fast, as long as you use a fast charger and cable.First thing I did though, was get a clear protective case, to protect that lovely blue case, as I carry the laptop around with me in a backpack, and don’t want to scratch it.All in all I’m very pleased with the Mac, yes it does take some getting use to, if you come over from a windows based machine, but it’s worth it in the end.

    Amazing laptop
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 August 2023,"







  
  
    First of all I'll just say that this laptop is very powerful, fabulous keyboard and feels and look much more robust than my previous 15"" model.The rest of my review regards my thoughts about purchasing the 14"" vs 16"" which was a big issue.However having now travelled and worked on the 14"" display I find it as good as my old 15"" display - in fact the difference in screen size is made up by the higher resolution on the 14"" anyway.I do like the portability of the 14"" and it stays relatively cool even when being used heavily.Do I wish I purchased the 16"" - no not at all. If you are looking for a laptop that the primary screen is the main display then the 16"" would better but for most of the time my laptop in the office is plugged into a 34 "" display and when I'm travelling the 14"" is easier to pack and carry around.TBH - this is by far the best laptop I have ever used and so pleased MagSafe and SD card slots are back.

    I work online regularly as a therapist and coach and needed the better visual experience with my clients and workshops  I have with my iPhone but on a larger screen. After hours of watching videos and reading reviews I chose the 14 m2 2023 and am so happy I did. My work is so much more pleasurable with an excellent camera and I’m no longer fiddling with add on webcams. The sound quality is also brilliant. Plus it’s wonderfully portable for my regional workshops as well. Very pleased with my purchase. This is an excellent upgrade from my 2015 MacPro which is still going strong.

    Difficult to factory reset
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2023,"







  
  
    When I first opened the macbook I was greeted with the macos ventura set up screen where I made my account as I was scrolling through the settings there was another account on the macbook called ""test"" whom observed admin controls, I tried to remove this account and I couldn't the screen would turn blank every time I tried so then I tried to factory reset the entire macbook and start it off fresh. I tried factory resetting and that didn't work I kept ending up with an error, I was worried about returning the macbook, thinking about the time I had wasted and what a waste this was. I kept on trying though and ended up resetting the macbook by erasing the hard disk and reinstalling macos ventura, the screen would also randomly shut off and never turn back on until I manually powered it on - this happened atleast 5x. But, finally the macbook started and I was once again greeted with the macos ventura setup so I continued and immediately went to check the users, and the ""test"" account was finally gone. What a relief.Advantages- Bright retina display- Good, loud speakers on both sides of the macbook air- No problems with any of the keys (so far)- Touch ID works perfectly- Managed to log into my Apple ID (I couldn't log in at the setup screen but after I set up the macbook I could in setting preferences)- Larger force touchpad- 2560 x 1600 resolution- NO FAN SOUNDS!! (even after using the macbook for long periods of time (e.g. 5 hrs))Disadvantages- Dirt under many of the keys due to the previous owner- American keyboard although I live in England- Hard to change any of the settings e.g. resetting, removing users- Small screen 13"" (could however be improved by purchasing the macbook pro model)- Slow wi-fi speed (all my other devices were at high speeds, except this macbook air but I fixed it by changing the DNS)- Battery runs out quicker than expected (it would most likely last me around 7-8 hours rather than 12-13 like advertised)- No genuine apple charge includedOverall, I would recommend this macbook air to any other students, like myself, or people who are simply doing light work on the macbook. E.g. editing online documents, reviewing flashcards, watching videos and films, checking e-mails. Would not recommend for editing intense (50+ min) videos due to the i5 processor. It is quite light and small so it is very portable - however I have read and watched many other reviews and after 3-4 months of using the macbook many people have experienced issues with the butterfly keyboard so be aware (dust gets caught under the keyboards due to how close the keys are to the base)

    A fantastic Macbook Pro. I'm thrilled with it so much that I've just ordered a Macbook Air for my daughter. I previously ordered a Mac book Pro from Wowcher and what was delivered was a very old unsupported one, so is useless, so if you are looking around for one, keep away from those sort of places and stick with Amazon. Unfortunately the company for the one on Wowcher don't reply to emails or answer the phone. You've got all the Amazon guarantees here and the company who supply the Macbook are top quality. Delivery was early, packaged well and the macbook is in fantastic condition.

    Once you’ve had one nothing else comes close. This is my second one. I had the first one for six years. My wife now has it for general word processing. There’s nothing wrong with it. I just wanted the speed of the new Apple chip for the complicated work I do. It leaves the fastest Intel chip for dead. And it’s so well made with a beautiful keyboard and a new larger track pad. If you want the best, only a new Mac Pro with the 16” screen will do.

    Best laptop I’ve ever owned!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 May 2023,"







  
  
    Bought on Amazon monthly payments last week (pay in 5), best laptop I’ve ever owned. Period. The battery life lasted me from Sunday until late on Wednesday without needing a recharge! Then when it does need a recharge? It’s back to full again in about 1.5 hours! The laptop is able to handle whatever I throw at it and even in the current heatwave I’ve not heard the fans kick in once or witnessed any signs of thermal throttling. It’s a power horse and a very silent one! But then what do you expect for over £3000? The very best! And that’s what you get. It’s much faster, much quieter, and much more efficient than any windows machine I have ever owned. And the battery life? It’s absolutely phenomenal! I went with the 16 inch M2 Max variant with 1TB SSD and 32GB unified memory. If you wish to choose the slightly lower specced M2 Pro variant though you will most likely have a very similar experience to myself. The Max shines in more graphically intensive tasks (due to double the GPU cores) so if you’re looking to play games or work with heavy graphics get the M2 Max. For anything else don’t feel bad about saving yourself some cash, just get the M2 Pro. My old laptop barely managed 3-4 hours on juice and the fans used to kick in within minutes of booting up so you can appreciate this feels like a massive upgrade! Also, before I forget, the 16 inch MacBook Pro screen is like an OLED TV on a laptop, it’s super bright (when viewing HDR), the blacks are true black, and the colours pop. 6 speakers produce incredible sound, the best I’ve heard on a laptop! Highly recommend if you’re able to purchase on instalments like I did. I’m glad I caved and bought it last week because the option to pay by instalments has mysteriously vanished for me this week. Money very well spent. Probably won’t need to upgrade for a fair few years! Yes they’ll keep releasing new macs every year that are way overspecced for the current generation of laptops but that’s the Apple way! Future-proofed right off the bat. Realistically? This machine will still be fast in 2-3 years. Possibly more. 32GB unified memory with Apple is somewhat on par with a 64GB windows machine. Not to mention that even if, on the rare or even improbable event that you run out of memory, it will just use SWAP on the super fast SSD. And a 1TB SSD has a pretty long lifespan compared to the baseline 256gb Mac models. Just remember to pick the right spec for you because you can’t change your mind afterwards.

    Marvellous machine but why no charging light?
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2023,"







  
  
    I won't recite technical details of this laptop as they can be found in many descriptions and reviews.Normally, I am a Win 11 user but there is something about the vibrancy of the 16.2"" screen of the Macbook Pro M2 that lured me to buy this. Somehow, it looks more polished.  It's a different way of working from Windows but it does not take long to adjust to clicking on the top left of a window rather than the right.This is a very fast computer. It boots up in seconds from just opening the lid and has really good Wi-Fi connectivity. It is a heavy laptop compared with the Mac Air and smaller screen Mac Pros, which you would expect. For me, it is not a laptop I'll be carrying around much. I do have an Air for that. I am fortunate enough to have a few laptops which I use for writing and web surfing. For ease of use and sheer power, I would say that the HP Pavilion  17""  is very similar although the Pavilion has a touch screen as well. Overall, the Mac 16.2"" is very impressive and the larger screen is worth the upgrade if you can afford it but there is a slight trade off in portability.What did surprise me was the surround sound quality of the speakers. They are really excellent.  Apple have manged to make a 3d sound effect like surround sound that really works in films  but particularly in certain Apple Music songs too.One thing that bugs me though, why is there no external charging light? You have to turn on the machine to see whether it is fully charged or not.

    Mobile Powerhouse
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2023,"







  
  
    I moved across from Windows to Mac OS when the 13” M1 MacBook Pro was released a couple of years ago and immediately began to love the Mac way of doing things and the insane production value and battery power of Apple silicon MacBooks.The one complaint I have was just that the machine itself was quite small in terms of screen real estate, and working on spreadsheets or multiple documents while on the move felt crowded.I decided to go for the 16” to give me the extra screen space and I’m so glad I did!  I can’t say that I notice the extra CPU cores since I’m mostly just browsing the web, producing documents or other office related tasks, but the machine itself is beautiful and the extra display space is game changing.The upgraded webcam, extra ports, better screen brightness and 120hz refresh rate are amazing additions too. But for me the battery life is the most noticeable upgrade. I used it on battery for a full working day and it was still just over 50%. The M1 was pretty good in this regard, but this is next level.The only downside is that the extra size/weight just make it that tiny bit less portable and easy to whip out or move between offices. In a backpack it’s not noticeable, but just carrying it from kitchen to lounge etc feels like more of a task than before, or using it on your lap on the train.  All are doable, but it’s no longer a one-hand easy movement.That, for me, is a very minor pain point on an otherwise beautiful device that will last me for years to come.Nice work Apple.

    Love my new MacBook Pro M2
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2023,"







  
  
    Bought this to replace an ageing MacBook Pro from 2015. Absolutely love this new machine. Was pondering a MacBook Air but decided to go for a Pro to help with photo and video editing. And to play games.Really impressed so far. I love the large screen as well - means that when I'm away from my home office set up I still have good screen real estate to work with. And the quality of the screen is incredible.I also have to call out the speakers. They've moved away from the tinny sound to a much fuller sound. I tend to use Sonos speakers, but the new MacBook Pro's speakers are to far off that level of sound / quality.

One downside is not about the laptop but it didn’t come in the Apple Original MacBook box sadly.

     **(I bought a laptop case prior to receiving this item, it does not come with the purchase)**I was extremely hesitant to purchase a refurbished MacBook, let alone one that wasn't directly from Apple. But I'm so glad I took the leap of faith because I'm absolutely thrilled with what I received. On day 1 of receiving the MacBook and inspecting it, it came in at 67% battery charge and couldn't wait to dive in and examine every detail.I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. The laptop was visibly very clean (100% no dents nor scratches ). The cycle count was at a reasonable 54, the condition was normal, and the maximum capacity battery life was at an impressive 100%. The keyboard was fully functional, and the speaker, Bluetooth, and WIFI were all working without any issues. I did notice that the Disk Utility SMART status was not supported, and I haven't had a chance to test the firmware password, but I'm not too worried about it.It was clear that the previous owner took excellent care of it, and I was excited to make it my own.I tested all the ports with a flash drive, external mouse, and dock, and everything was working seamlessly. The only downside was that the charger didn't seem to work. But I plan on reaching out to the seller to request a replacement.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality refurbished MacBook. Don't be hesitant like I was - take the plunge, and you won't be disappointed!---UPDATE---I wanted to update my previous review to share that I had a great experience with the seller when it came to the charger issue. I reached out to them, and they promptly exchanged the faulty charger for a good one within a day. I was so relieved and appreciative that they were willing to rectify the situation.Now that I've been using the refurbished MacBook for a week, I can confidently say that it's still functioning perfectly. I've put it through its paces with hours of movie-watching, programming and coding, school work, web browsing, and basic PC use. Even with all of that usage, the battery still performs optimally and can last for a little over a day without needing to be charged.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This refurbished MacBook is a great value for the money, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality laptop that won't break the bank.

    Avoid. Faulty laptop and told the only option I have is a 14 day repair....
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2023,"







  
  
    I purchased this MacBook from Amazon based on the fact that generally if I ever have a problem their customer service are next level and sort the issue promptly. I contacted them when I received the item to say that the trackpad was quite tricky to push down on, the bottom of the laptop was uneven (as if someone had opened it) and that if you run your hand over the outer shell of the screen it has a buzz as if it is electrical shock. This has gone on now since August. Had been told basically the trackpad would loosen up with time. So I took time and here we are now they refuse to take it back for a refund and only offering repair for 14 days. I am self employed and my job is on my laptop, I am not stuck between being without my laptop for 14 days or just trying to use it with faults. This is the first time I have ever been absolutely disgusted with Amazon and their customer service. Paul was extremely rude and patronising in his responses. Expected a much better service for the money spent.

Once it’s all set up you can switch between all your iOS devices to continue to work on whatever device your on.Pros,Compact, bright clear screen, fingerprint ID, No fan nosies, fast SSD, Great intuitive keyboard, and many many more,Cons, .Only one, some iPhone apps are not on Mac iOS like chrome, gmail, word, and more so you will have to use Safari.

     **(I bought a laptop case prior to receiving this item, it does not come with the purchase)**I was extremely hesitant to purchase a refurbished MacBook, let alone one that wasn't directly from Apple. But I'm so glad I took the leap of faith because I'm absolutely thrilled with what I received. On day 1 of receiving the MacBook and inspecting it, it came in at 67% battery charge and couldn't wait to dive in and examine every detail.I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. The laptop was visibly very clean (100% no dents nor scratches ). The cycle count was at a reasonable 54, the condition was normal, and the maximum capacity battery life was at an impressive 100%. The keyboard was fully functional, and the speaker, Bluetooth, and WIFI were all working without any issues. I did notice that the Disk Utility SMART status was not supported, and I haven't had a chance to test the firmware password, but I'm not too worried about it.It was clear that the previous owner took excellent care of it, and I was excited to make it my own.I tested all the ports with a flash drive, external mouse, and dock, and everything was working seamlessly. The only downside was that the charger didn't seem to work. But I plan on reaching out to the seller to request a replacement.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality refurbished MacBook. Don't be hesitant like I was - take the plunge, and you won't be disappointed!---UPDATE---I wanted to update my previous review to share that I had a great experience with the seller when it came to the charger issue. I reached out to them, and they promptly exchanged the faulty charger for a good one within a day. I was so relieved and appreciative that they were willing to rectify the situation.Now that I've been using the refurbished MacBook for a week, I can confidently say that it's still functioning perfectly. I've put it through its paces with hours of movie-watching, programming and coding, school work, web browsing, and basic PC use. Even with all of that usage, the battery still performs optimally and can last for a little over a day without needing to be charged.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This refurbished MacBook is a great value for the money, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality laptop that won't break the bank.

     **(I bought a laptop case prior to receiving this item, it does not come with the purchase)**I was extremely hesitant to purchase a refurbished MacBook, let alone one that wasn't directly from Apple. But I'm so glad I took the leap of faith because I'm absolutely thrilled with what I received. On day 1 of receiving the MacBook and inspecting it, it came in at 67% battery charge and couldn't wait to dive in and examine every detail.I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. The laptop was visibly very clean (100% no dents nor scratches ). The cycle count was at a reasonable 54, the condition was normal, and the maximum capacity battery life was at an impressive 100%. The keyboard was fully functional, and the speaker, Bluetooth, and WIFI were all working without any issues. I did notice that the Disk Utility SMART status was not supported, and I haven't had a chance to test the firmware password, but I'm not too worried about it.It was clear that the previous owner took excellent care of it, and I was excited to make it my own.I tested all the ports with a flash drive, external mouse, and dock, and everything was working seamlessly. The only downside was that the charger didn't seem to work. But I plan on reaching out to the seller to request a replacement.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality refurbished MacBook. Don't be hesitant like I was - take the plunge, and you won't be disappointed!---UPDATE---I wanted to update my previous review to share that I had a great experience with the seller when it came to the charger issue. I reached out to them, and they promptly exchanged the faulty charger for a good one within a day. I was so relieved and appreciative that they were willing to rectify the situation.Now that I've been using the refurbished MacBook for a week, I can confidently say that it's still functioning perfectly. I've put it through its paces with hours of movie-watching, programming and coding, school work, web browsing, and basic PC use. Even with all of that usage, the battery still performs optimally and can last for a little over a day without needing to be charged.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This refurbished MacBook is a great value for the money, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality laptop that won't break the bank.

     **(I bought a laptop case prior to receiving this item, it does not come with the purchase)**I was extremely hesitant to purchase a refurbished MacBook, let alone one that wasn't directly from Apple. But I'm so glad I took the leap of faith because I'm absolutely thrilled with what I received. On day 1 of receiving the MacBook and inspecting it, it came in at 67% battery charge and couldn't wait to dive in and examine every detail.I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. The laptop was visibly very clean (100% no dents nor scratches ). The cycle count was at a reasonable 54, the condition was normal, and the maximum capacity battery life was at an impressive 100%. The keyboard was fully functional, and the speaker, Bluetooth, and WIFI were all working without any issues. I did notice that the Disk Utility SMART status was not supported, and I haven't had a chance to test the firmware password, but I'm not too worried about it.It was clear that the previous owner took excellent care of it, and I was excited to make it my own.I tested all the ports with a flash drive, external mouse, and dock, and everything was working seamlessly. The only downside was that the charger didn't seem to work. But I plan on reaching out to the seller to request a replacement.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality refurbished MacBook. Don't be hesitant like I was - take the plunge, and you won't be disappointed!---UPDATE---I wanted to update my previous review to share that I had a great experience with the seller when it came to the charger issue. I reached out to them, and they promptly exchanged the faulty charger for a good one within a day. I was so relieved and appreciative that they were willing to rectify the situation.Now that I've been using the refurbished MacBook for a week, I can confidently say that it's still functioning perfectly. I've put it through its paces with hours of movie-watching, programming and coding, school work, web browsing, and basic PC use. Even with all of that usage, the battery still performs optimally and can last for a little over a day without needing to be charged.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This refurbished MacBook is a great value for the money, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality laptop that won't break the bank.

    Why buy new?
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2023,"







  
  
    I bought this for someone whose demands of a phone are modest but who appreciates quality. It was too early to upgrade on her contract so we simply kept it going and swapped SIMs over.The phone was correctly described in excellent condition; in fact you wouldn’t realise it’s been used before.If you don’t need every bell and whistle, why buy new?

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2023,"







  
  
    I bought it to replace my ailing iPhone, the damn thing wouldn’t charge for ages. It took a full day to charge around 30%. I could have returned it but decided to keep it as a spare. It’s annoying because it should have been checked properly to save me the hassle, we’re all time poor! Apart from that the phone works as expected. You get what you pay for I suppose, you buy $#!7 you buy x2!

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    I bought Skullcandy Mod, it has a nice quality sound.It fits very nicely in the ear, I haven't done any rigorous movement yet in it though.Skullcandy ModPros▪️Multi point connection - can connect to 2 devices at once▪️Can customize inputs i.e. 2 taps for skip or volume up, pause and so on intuitive indeed▪️ supported on app▪️Turns off automatically in charging case▪️Can find headphones on Til▪️Headphones can be used solo and doesn't hinder usage muchCons▪️Button albiet versatile in terms of custom they are pretty tough and require more pressue than I would like but doesn't mean can accidentally change or pause▪️The charging case is hugePossible con, not sure if my phone or not but when connecting to my S7 it seems to have a issue when in my pocket,  it cuts out like it is skipping. On my S10, seems to be better.It is rated ip55, which is great for protection.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2023,"







  
  
    I had to return these due to the sound quality diminishing from a all ready lackluster levelafter 1 month. They would of received 2 stars because the design and battery life were quite well done however, I replaced these with the skullcandy indy anc and it blows the mods out of the water with the benefit of the skullcandy design. So in summary 1 star as they pale in comparsion to other models in this price range from this brand.Good chargeUsb c type charge portgood fit in earwill stay in unless you shake your head side to side aggressively.Earbuds buttons usefulUseful appNow the sound. I would only use for podcasts but even then they aren't great. Any slight noise around you will make the sound very hard to hear and often impossible. Even in a quiet environment sound is low. It's very disappointing from skullcandy who up till this point have been very reliable. I also checked with another person to make sure I wasn't just deaf and they confirmed how quiet they are, although when you can hear them sound is clear at least

    If you want to shoot in portrait…
  
",Reviewed in the United States on 9 October 2023,"







  
  
    If you want to shoot in portrait you should know that with the design of this the light ends up on one side of you instead of directly in front resulting in a shadowy background. Plus when in portrait, since the weight shifts to one side, it tends to tip over when used as a stand - making you have to get it just right every time just so it won’t fall over and also making it a pain in the ____ to push a button on the screen and keep your shot.  The light charges fairly quick and is bright. The microphone is good at close range but could be better at more than 1 meter. Hand held use isn’t good for steady video but it’s a sufficient selfie stick type of option. Not worth the price if that’s all you use it for tho.

    Very good for beginners, but just one caveat
  
",Reviewed in the United States on 27 June 2020,"







  
  
    First off, I would like to say this kit is actually really really good for the money. I was looking for something that was fairly inexpensive, so I could put together a few videos for my workplace as well as instructional videos for some friends with my iPhone. This does that in spades, a very good carrying case, nothing feels cheap or flimsy in it. Comes with a good microphone and decent light. It was easy to set up for the most part, however, just one thing that I wish came with the kit was at least a small set of instructions to explain certain things. Keep in mind, I'm coming from a 100% newbie into this type of stuff, so, I didn't really have a good idea how stuff works when it came to this. So, here's just a few things I found out:1. The base that mounts the light and microphone doesn't have a cut out in the case, it's in the mesh pocket.2. The light, while decent, doesn't have a ton of run time, so keep that in mind.3. The microphone when plugged in, at least for my iphone 11, didn't have any indication that it was working. The only way I knew is I downloaded a decibel meter to test it. With an iphone 11 (I have no idea about android devices, or other iphone series) the microphone is just plug and play and it works.4. The microphone has two settings on it a bent line and a straight line, which in no way shape or form is described what they do, after some research I can tell you that the the bent line cuts out low frequency, which means that the sound of air conditioner, microwave, ceiling fan, etc. is muted. The straight line means that it will pick up these noises. So bent line reduces ambient noise, straight line picks up all noise.Hopefully this review helps some people out, this is a great product in my opinion, just needs a manual to help explain things to 100% newbies like me when it comes to vlogging and video recording.

    Wrong colour
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2022,"







  
  
    I ordered a green iPhone 11 and got white for some odd reason, nothing in the packaging told me why I got white. The phone came late, I was told it would arrive on the 29th Nov but due to strikes it came on the 2nd Dec, I'm happy it at least came in the end.The phone itself is great so far, easy transfer from my old iPhone 6s and the face recognition is pretty much instant only issue is it came with 87% battery health.I got a free charger that came with it, plug and wire.

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    I ordered the graphite iPhone 13 Pro. In my opinion graphite is the most elegant and sleek followed by silver. I honestly think they gave me a brand new one because mine came with 100% battery and absolutely no scratches. I was looking super close and at every angle of the phone and not one scratch can be seen. I’m so happy with it 🥰 saving money and being sustainable at the same time❤️

    Was almost put off buying this phone having read through previous reviews but I am so glad I went for it. Item arrived within 2 days with DPD and is in excellent condition, far better than what I was expecting having purchased ‘good condition’. Battery life is 98%. I feel like I’ve got a brand new phone, you’d never know it was second hand. Really impressed

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    Bought this iPad for my older sons Christmas disappointed full of dull scratches was supposed to be like new but no where near. But one last year for my youngest son and it looke brand new. So if I’d ordered earlier in the year I would’ve definitely sent it back only because of the postal strikes I kept it. But to be hones pretty disappointed

    SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8: Blending Power, Performance, and Affordability
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2023,"







  
  
    From the moment I laid hands on the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5” Android Tablet, I felt a wave of excitement surge through me. I had just traded up from my week-old tablet, shattered by a small accident, and immediately, the potential of the Galaxy Tab A8 seemed limitless. Here, I've curated a comprehensive review of this device, drawn from my personal experience and bolstered by user feedback to deliver a true journalistic, fact-based, and SEO-friendly perspective.Firstly, I was smitten by the robust and seamless connectivity the Galaxy Tab A8 offered with my Samsung cellphone, including its cellular data. This feature transformed my disappointment about the lack of cellular connectivity in the tablet into a sense of satisfaction. It gave me the freedom to talk, text, browse the web and much more.

    Great tablet only let down by Amazon delivery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2023,"







  
  
    This was a replacement for a Lenovo who's UI was the source of much frustration. The Samsung runs Android as you'd expect. The only negative thing I can say is the screen brightness seems below par, but I can live with that.What's been realy poor is Amazon's delivery. Signed up for prime, was supposed to be next day delivery but not calls or no emails to say there was an issue. Logged in to account when package failed to appear only to fin it had been collected by courier but then returned. Update said delivery late, if not received in 3 days time check account again. I appreciate things can go wrong, but when I cancelled Prime, Amazon charged me for Prime services that had failed.So I cancelled the ordered and bought my machine from Argos which I collected same day.Your communication needs to be better Amazon.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2023,"







  
  
    I thought that the price was reasonable and thought that I was getting a slightly better tablet than the A6. Being Samsung I have not been disappointed with their products, unfortunately that changed with this tablet. The first thing that struck me was the amount of time it took to start up, laborious, then the screen, no matter how I tried to tweak the settings the screen looks washed out, then I looked at some professional write up. It explained that this tablet contained processors and screens that were passed their sell by date, in fact one reviewer was scathing for Samsungs use of such low value components.Then some of the settings seem bizzare, being used to tablet settings over many years this tablet had very limiting functions for their settings, especially the screen. One it is up and running it runs ok but photos are what I do for a hobby and no matter what I try they look below par compaired to my A6. It's still a Samsung and although not running the latest Android version it has been updated by Samsung. The large screen is a bonus but I can't get over how washed out everything seems, I have it now so will make the most of it.

    Does NOT have WideVine L1 (despite advertising it)
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2023,"







  
  
    The tablet is ok for the price and seems sturdy.  There is a big issue though.  It advertises WideVine L1 support - necessary to get HD streaming on many apps (e.g. Netflix) but it does not.When streaming netflix the app reports the device as being WideVine L3 compliant with a max resolution of SD (480p).This is substandard for 2023 viewing.A similar issue occurs on YouTube.  You cannot get better than 720p streaming despite setting the app to stream in the highest quality.So to sum up:Pros+ Cheap+ Decent build quality (or so it feels)+ Runs smoothly thanks to 8GB ram and Android 12Cons+ SD viewing on streaming apps despite L1 claims+ Free case that is bundled with it is dire.  It's made of the shiny smooth plastic TPU stuff you get in phone cases and looks cool when you take it out the box.  On use you realise why all other cases have a material that's a bit more course.  When you set the case to sit the tablet up on its side it is so slippy that it just falls apart under its own weight in seconds.  There's no grip for the case to keep in the upright positionFree yes (or was when I bought this tablet on a deal for £80)But also garbageIf SD streaming doesn't bother you - and you can get it for the £80/£90 Amazon were offering it on October's prime day it's decentPersonally the streaming is too big a deal-breaker and I'm returning due to false advertisement

    Good but with a problem
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 June 2023,"







  
  
    The tablet arrived very quickly and it was very quick and easy to set it up and get started. The tablet seems to be quick and responsive and I am generally pleased with it. However, there is an issue that when I try to access Display settings via the Settings App I am just taken straight out of the App and back to the previous screen. I have contacted Teclast and they suggested reloading the firmware via a link that they sent me. I did this although it was not as easy as it should be due to the limited instructions and unclear narrative. However, this did not resolve the issue and Teclast are now advising me to return the tablet to the supplier for maintenance. This does not actually seem to be an option as the only option given by Amazon is for a refund. I found the Teclast support responsive and helpful with the only issue being the time taken to respond which was between 24 and 36 hours each time. Other than the above issue the tablet seems to work ok and all other menu options that I have tried to access so far seem to work.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2023,"







  
  
    Bought two of these, one for each of our kids, think it was about 80 quid with a discount. Bought a 2nd one as the 1st was quite impressive. They’ve been in use for about 4 months and not had a problem with either. Screen quality very good and a great priced tablet. The volume could be better (goes from q low to q high) the camera is a bit grainy and I’d suggest you get a screen protector for 10quid as the screen is prone to scratching. For under a 100 quid you can’t go wrong.

    So easy to use
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 August 2023,"







  
  
    I've always used android products but i switched to fire tablets because of the cost. I found them hard to use and the lack of useful apps made them almost useless.I bought this tablet and i feel like I'm back using something intuitive and useful.  It copied all the apps off my phone so more i have everything i use regularly on my tablet.The browser is fast and doesn't take over settings.It has a lot of memory (but then i don't save much to my tablets so take that into account if you do). It runs quickly.  The only thing I'd say is a little but if a pain is that you have to recharge it around every 3 days. Again,  more of a preference than a major issue.Personally I'd recommend this for someone who uses their tablet for reading,  checking out the Internet,  social media and running apps.  I can't say how much the memory would support but i can say that it runs quickly and is very intuitive.I'm really happy with mine.

    Very good value for the money
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2023,"







  
  
    Bought this to replace a 2yo Android tablet for my 7yo son. The Android tablet had gotten slower and slower (as they always seem to do). My daughter has had this model of ipad for 5 years and it still works like new so I thought I'd try a renewed model as brand new ipads don't come cheap.The device turned up reasonably well packaged and protected in plain box. I was slightly disappointed that an actual charger wasn't included, just a charging cable. Not a huge problem, but ipads generally charge faster with a more powerful charger rather than the standard USB ones.The ipad itself is in very good condition. There are a couple of cosmetic marks on the back of the cover and there is some evidence around the screen bezel that the screen has been removed or replaced at some point (but at least this indicates some level of servicing has been carried out). However these cosmetic imperfections are not a problem as it will be going in a protective case anyway. The screen itself is flawless so no complaints there at all.I've set up the ipad and connected to wifi, it updated automatically to the latest ios version. No issues with usage, everything seems to work as expected, including bluetooth, headphone socket, and fingerprint sensor. Downloaded all the games and apps my son uses, no problems.Haven't used it intensively yet so not sure about the battery life. It charged well enough and on standby has lasted fine so I don't expect any problems, although I would't expect it to perform like new.TBH I would have given 4.5 stars if possible. It was only really the lack of a charger in the box that slightly let it down. Very pleased overall.

La batería totalmente muerta, únicamente estando conectada prendía la pantalla, es increíble que alguien se atreva a vender algo así.

    A Lightbulb moment
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2023,"







  
  
    For the last 5 years my previous iPad was stuck in a drawer because I was finding that a combination of iPhone and Mac met my needs. However, I was spending long hours at my desk (which did nothing for posture) or tapping emails and documents on my iPhone (bad for eyesight and plenty of predictive text awkward words for thought or I mis-read) (also bad for RSI).Increasingly I handle home and work tasks on my phone and when I go away I lug my laptop. ‘Lug’ because although it is lightweight, once the fast charger cable and shock protection case are added in it becomes more cumbersome.Three days ago I started something off relaxed on the bed but it was slow and I was squinting so I had to treck to the study. I couldn’t figure out why I had stopped using the iPad, which by now was gathering dust. It is still okay but I compared screen size and weight with the Air 5th generation and decided that I could justify upgrading.I did look at the larger Pro (12 inch diagonal) but it was seven ounces heavier and larger screen size obviously means larger item of kit. Also the Pro has a lot of elements that are of use for graphic designers and the like and would be wasted in terms of my needs.Here I am. Moved data across to new iPad, synchronised Dropbox and Mail and I have a larger screen (enough to make a difference) and the latest in hardware. I use Mac dictate where suitable - it wasn’t safe on the iPhone because I failed to spot inaccuracies due to the screen size. I also took the plunge and bought a Magic Keyboard for work such as spreadsheets where I find it very difficult to handle on a tablet.Why a Mac tablet? Because there just seems to be more thought into the ergonomics and operating system. Also because I have been on a Mac desktop for several years and it is very reliable. I have full integration across 4 Mac devices (phone, tablet, laptop and desktop).Is the 5th generation a sea change? It is more an evolution but with a distinct and yet intangible difference. I usually upgrade every third year because year on year the changes are too small to justify the outlay even though I can get something on trade in.Has it changed my life compare with using the five year old one? No but it just has a better feel. Apple generations are iterative and a tweak here and an extra facility there make for a better experience, just as with changing a car after a while. It still only gets you from A to B but the journey is easier.Why buy from Amazon? Saved a few bob but mainly because Amazon is very good on the rare occasion I need to return an item. By contrast, Apple led me a merry dance when they delivered a piece of kit (a fast charger when I couldn’t find my laptop fast charger) and provided the wrong lead to go with it. All on a recorded call with Apple clearly stating the cable needed.If you are not sure which IPad you want, the Apple site offers a very clear side by side comparison and I read a coupe of technical reviews of the ‘which is best for your needs?’ type.Star rating is because I find Apple functionality faultless. It can take a while to convert from Microsoft or other operating systems but I quickly realised how well thought out the Max OS is. The stars are the same as for all Apple kit i have bought except the keyboard that goes with the desktop. I don’t get that but only because I like a large keyboard.

    Normally you pay through the nose for storage on an ipad. Buying this older model when my battery failed to charge after 10 years was a good idea. Works perfectly with all the same limitations built into apple, but excellent streaming of TV and video. Annoying auxiliary control button on the screen which you keep hitting and cant be suppressed.

Slight scuff mark on the back but who doesn’t put a protective case in these apple products- especially if for children.

The I-pad was partly charged, enabling immediate setting up which was a god touch and after the additionally purchased Screen Protector and Case were fitted, it was good to go within twenty minutes.  This is the second device I’ve bought “pre-owned” and the level of care prior to sale is to be commended.

    I bought this iPad as a replacement for a previous iPad that I had bought which I had to return due to being damaged (not from this seller) and I had no idea how awful the previous iPad was until I bought this one! The screen functions are great and even work with knock off apple pens, saving me a lot of money. It has fantastic battery life, it lasts me all day at university and barely is impacted by my 6 hours worth of seminars. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to use an iPad in their student life. I haven’t had it for very long though, which is my only comment so I will be interested to see if it continues to be functional.

    Good performance and lots of useful features
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2023,"







  
  
    I bought this tablet when I retired and had more time to sit around reading emails, keeping up with social media, and streaming box sets of TV series I never had time to watch. It does all of these admirably, and serves me well.The 10"" screen is crisp and clear and has a good viewing angle should you wish to share it with others, for example during a video call. I don't know much about processor types and speeds, but there is enough oomph to power all the apps I use without the screen flickering or pixelating.The onboard storage is pretty reasonable at 64Gb, but if you like to download lots of movies etc you can add a memory card, giving up to 512Gb extra. Some well-known tablets don't offer this facility, and instead sell a range of models with different storage sizes. I find it hard to know my requirements in  advance, so the ability to upgrade as needed is extremely useful and reassuring.Next to the slot for the memory card are two SIM card slots, enabling you to connect to the Internet when there's no WiFi. I tried this out with an inexpensive non-contract SIM and it worked well, first during a car journey, and then in the caravan. Two SIM cards would have doubled the speed, but I found that just one was enough for email, social media and YouTube. There was a little bit of buffering when streaming TV, but it was within acceptable limits.Accessing the slots for the memory and SIM cards was a bit fiddly; you have to prise off a plastic strip that doesn't feel like it wants to be removed, and I was frightened I might break the case. But it did come off safely in the end, and it certainly won't fall off accidentally!The operating system is Android 11 GO. I wasn't familiar with Android, but setup was easy and guided, so I was soon up and running and connected to WiFi. It took me a little while to get used to the slight differences to my mobile phone, but my 7-year-old grandson was happy to teach me! All the usual apps are available in the Play Store. I use Google password manager on my phone and PC, so most of the apps installed and logged in automatically.After a while doing simple things and getting used to it, I started to investigate Android versions of apps I normally use on my PC with its big screen and extra CPU power. I was surprised to find they worked well, and I now use the tablet to view and edit music, rather than carrying around sheets of paper. From simply using the tablet for TV, YouTube, music and so on, I'm now using it for much more, thanks to its convenient size, weight, and CPU power.The tablet comes with free accessories to make this easy: a case, a screen protector, and an on-the-go (OTG) cable. I hadn't seen an OTG cable before but I quickly discovered its usefulness. You plug one end into the tablet's USB (type C) port, and the other end is a standard USB socket, so that you can attach all sorts of useful USB devices just as you would on a PC. I've attached memory sticks, and a keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse was useful, as I can type much faster than I can poke an on-screen keyboard with a finger. Not all USB devices are automatically supported, though, so beware. When you plug a USB device into a PC, the PC will search for the appropriate drivers; these can be found online and are often only available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. This will no doubt change over time, but for now only the simpler devices are supported.The tablet comes equipped with WiFi and Bluetooth, and also has a 3.5mm headphone output, which I like because it enables me to connect the tablet into my sound system to provide backing tracks.I like the design of the tablet. In 'landscape' mode, which is best for most things, the volume buttons and on/off switch are easily accessible on the right-hand side, and the USB charging cable plugs in at the top. My main criticism is that the speakers - which are quite good quality - are on the bottom edge. I often use a padded support to hold the tablet, so I don't have to hold it, and the speakers can get muffled by the padded ledge it sits on. Most times I'm using bluetooth headphones, so it doesn't matter, but placing the speakers on the top edge would have better.The user-facing camera is on the top edge, ideal for video calls. At 6MP this camera is fine for this application; network lag is the usual problem so a higher resolution would potentially cause more problems. A 13MP camera is on the other side. I haven't really used this a lot, as a tablet isn't the easiest way of taking a picture. I have used it on occasions for taking a picture of a document, or something small that I needed to enlarge to a size that suited my eyes, and it works very well. But when I go for a walk, I take my phone rather than my tablet, simply because of the more convenient size.To conclude: I like this tablet. It does everything I want, and probably more. It's robust and has been dropped, kicked, and used as a coffee coaster without any ill-effect. The screen is good, the free accessories are actually useful, and the ability to expand the storage, and to connect to the Internet via a SIM card sets it apart. It's incredibly good value for the price and you can buy with assurance, knowing that what you buy today can be expanded to meet future needs.

    Autorotate not fully operational, and when I set it up with Facebook the first time I had endless videos and pictures which were, to put it bluntly,soft porn! As a tablet ,apart from content to date, seems good and on a par with my more expensive one, this one was for my husband to watch utube and motorbikes after his old one died! I would recommend it as a lower budget bit of kit to buy

    I got this to mount on my karaoke machine and it does the job brilliantly. Pretty straight forward to set up from the word go, no issues. Battery life is super.The only downside to this tablet is when trying to use it in the sunlight, you can virtually see nothing unless you shade the screen. Great for indoors but I took it on holiday to read my books whilst sunbathing and it was no good. Other than that, great

    Great Tablet
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2023,"







  
  
    This tablet is great for the price. Obviously not as good as a high end tablet but great for social media, games, YouTube etc.  I comes with a case which doubles as a stand which is a bonus.The only drawback I have found so far is the location of the buttons.  If using the tablet in portrait mode on a stand, the buttons get pressed. It seems an unusual place to place the power and volume buttons.Other than that, all good.

    Pleasantly Surprised
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2023,"







  
  
    I'm comparing it to Samsung products, which is hardly fair... a totally different price bracket. However, I have been pleasantly surprised. the main difference is the OS. They have trimmed the features down, some of the fancier controls like kiddie restrictions are not quite the same. The whole feel is a wee bit more budget and lower performance. However... my 5 year old has been using it for 2 months now and not destroyed it. I could also just about handle it if they did throw it across the room, a good solution for a low cost pad to let kids do homework and look things up. A very capable pad, just not quite as slick as the high end ones.

    Toscido 10 inch Tablet
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2023,"







  
  
    I bought this tablet as there have been very many good reviews on here.  It all looked good when I opened the box, but unfortunately, I found it impossible to open the SIM card tray to insert a memory card.  I was in danger of breaking it by trying to force it so everything fell at the first hurdle.  Such a shame that this couldn't have been designed better and made more usable.  I have decided to return the tablet and look for something that is more user friendly.UPDATE 21.04.23I have amended my initial review from 2 stars to 4, to reflect the excellent customer service I received from the seller.  They suggested another of their products, and offered a discount.  In the end, I didn't take them up on the offer, but they were very anxious to make sure I was happy.  I know that there are many satisfied customers of this tablet and perhaps it was just me who found opening the SIM card tray difficult, but rest assured, if you own this product and have any problems, the seller will be very happy to try and resolve them to your satisfaction.

    My husband's ancient tablet finally gave up the ghost so I wanted a budget replacement as all he does is faff about looking at sports news and falling down Youtube holes when he can't sleep at night and he doesn't need one with all the bells and whistles for that.This has far more than he needs and is excellent value for money. The screen is good, resolution nice and clear, the speed is quick and the sound is good. A definite bargain and a very good buy.

    Apple iPad 256GB, Great Product, Dreadful Seller experience
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2023,"







  
  
    I have absolutely no problem with Apple products, I love them, the issue here is the seller. (EXPRESS GADGETS).I am a long time Prime member of Amazon and love it, however his is the first time I have purchased a used electrical item and the experience is not good so far.The iPad arrived as ordered with my Prime membership, not in the original box and not overly protected by the seller but not a real issue there as it was a used item (refurbished).The product was as described, used refurbished in A1 condition and I was happy, however, within the first two weeks a fault started appearing intermittently on the screen, this showed as a series of fine vertical lines running horizontally from top to bottom of the screen. Having previously owned multiple iPads and iPhones that never showed this issue I decided to return the product as faulty, and that's when the problem arose.The seller contacted me on receipt of the returned iPad showing me a picture or the fault on the screen and said that it was damaged and they would need to replace the screen and therefore could only refund me 60% of the £379.99 I had paid which left me out of pocket by £147.99 plus P&P.I replied saying this was not damage but a fault, however the seller has completely ignored my request for a full refund or a replacement product and won't respond to my messages, so have escalated this to an official complaint to Amazon.As I write (20th June 2023) I am now waiting for Amazon to respond to my complaint about the seller, so when they have looked into it and responded I will update this post.Hopefully it will be a satisfactory outcome.Gavin A.23rd June 2023.Good news to report, and Bravo to Amazon for refunding me the balance that the seller wouldn't.I don't know the outcome as to whether Amazon has claimed this back from the seller or not, but either way I am fully refunded. So 5 x Stars to Amazon *****I still want another iPad so will start looking again, still no response or replies from the seller, so, needless to say I will be avoiding EXPESS GADGETS in future.My recommendation, be very wary of this seller.

    Superb condition of a classic Ipad
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2023,"







  
  
    I bought this Ipad as a replacement for an older version that is now on it's last legs. I was pleasantly surprised at how new, clean and shiny this reconditioned one is. The functions are all good and in great working order, unlike my old, battered one. It does what I need it for, mainly via safari and so I have no issues. I don't really use many 'apps' and that is not what I bought it for. Therefore it ticks all my boxes and I was impressed at how well the product was packaged and delivered. These guys obviously care about their products and that is why I have given an honest review. Well done guys !

    Much the same, but...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2023,"







  
  
    Lovely product as always, but rather let down by its inability to use the latest Ipen, and very little warning that this is the case. Older pen not as good requiring wire to charge and then not being usable whilst charging. Also requires a wee adapter which just adds to charging annoyance (which we all know leads to things not being charged, and often dying) a bit sad the latest ipad doesn't allow latest pen, and that it feels like Apple is trying to force upgrades. Which would work better if people knew it was an issue, I would've probably bought different version if I had known. And yes, we should probably research this before hand, but this is where Apple usually are, very in house and compatible with their own devices.Also annoying with the main weather applet being displayed when GPS never works, it simply can never find where I am, and although can add places the main screen really wants to display the first option. Meaning you have a big ugly empty Applet on your main screen. Again, not what you expect from Apple. But after much researching found the way around it and the optionsto make it display what I wanted, albeit all rather hidden.But that's only complaints and doesn't detract from what is still a quality product with a lovely display. For what we use ot for it is lovely. It replaces an original Air which was getting a bit long in the tooth, and battery life now practically dead. Also software versions becoming more problematic

    Apple iPad is the best. I wore out my previous one after 6 years use. This is slightly bigger but charges very quick and holds battery time well. I use it every day quite a bit due to an illness I am partly house bound , so use it more than some people would normally. Despite price it is good value, don’t know anything else that could beat it.

    Really good earphones
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 September 2023,"







  
  
    These are really good budget earphones. Ive been using these for around a year with hardly any issues. The design on them is really sleek. They are really comfortable and cant feel them in my ears sometimes only knowing they are there due to the fact i can hear the music being played. They are really easy to use just opening up the case and by the time i have put them in my ears they have connected to my phone. The sound quality is average but hasnt got worse in any way. The charging case easily lasts around 2-3 weeks before needing a charge again for me depending on usage with the earphones lasting around 4 hours at a time

    Excellent headphones
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 August 2023,"







  
  
    I bought these as a first time Bluetooth experience with headphones and I was pleasantly surprised how good they are. The sound  is excellent there is no other noises with these headphones, they completely shut out any other noise, they are a bit tricky to use at first but when you have got used to them they are excellent. They also charge really easily and it lasts a long time too.  The case recharges the headphones in the case which is really efficient. Nice sleek looking colour and case. Comes with charging cable which is short but effective. Definitely recommend them they also connect to any phone or Bluetooth device very quickly. Just make sure you turn them off properly when finished with there use.

    these are ok, disappointed that ""noise cancelling"" function is not what the description implies
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2022,"







  
  
    These are only ok.If you're looking for earbuds and don't want to spend ""Sony"" money, then these are somewhat good candidates. Too bad they _don't_ have the noise cancelling functionality that the headline description implies they do. If I'd managed to glean that info from a full description vs. headline description comparison, then I wouldn't have purchased them.Pros:1) Can't fault the sound quality, though I am no audiophile. They compare favourably to (though certainly don't exceed) the sound quality of a set of Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds that I've used extensively.2) I very much like the LED power level on the case, hugely useful. I also like that the case charges via USB-C.3) Being able to use either the right or the left earbud independently is also very useful.4) When they are in my ears, they can be quite comfortable (though I don't use them for sports)5) Batteries do last longer than the Sonys, but those are over a year old, so I don't expect them to perform at their best in that respect.Minor Cons1) They are a little awkward to get out of their case, a bit of a surprising design fault (takes a ""scooping"" technique, and sometimes this leads to me pressing the touch-sensitive button, and then that function happens unexpectedly)2) None of the 3 sizes of silicone eartips work to create a good seal in my particular ear canals (really necessary to get a good bass response). I have to really force them in while twisting a bit to get the best performance. I'm going to have to source a foam alternative (the Sonys are far better in that respect: they always made a perfect seal due to their their shape + foam eartips).3) despite the photos in the product's page here on Amazon, the touch-sensitive area _is not_ the tubular structure, rather it's the side of the body of the earbuds (easy to figure out though).Major ConWhat really annoys me about them is that I found them after doing a search for ""noise cancelling"" here on Amazon, but they aren't what a reasonable person would accept as noise cancelling earbuds. The description contains: ""...Wireless Earphones Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earphones..."", but the ""noise cancelling"" is just for calls, definitely _not_ what I would expect from the headline description. I was quite disappointed about that (yes yes, the ""noise cancelling while calling"" functionality is described deeper in the product page, but I don't feel it's reasonable for me to have to carefully compare two bodies of information in a single page in order to determine the _real_ functions of a product). I bought these specifically for my office, where there are many computer fans going at all times. I can still hear all that fan noise with these in (even if I manage to make a good seal). Disappointing.SummarySo if  you're looking to for some decent true wireless earbuds at far below what you'd pay for Sony/Bose/Jabra/etc versions, then these are worth checking out. Just beware of all the caveats.

    Battery not good
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2022,"







  
  
    The headphones were great. I owned them for about a month, then I noticed that the battery in the actual headphones drops very quickly. I used to be able to use them for 6-8 hours without needing to charge the individual headphones. How I can only use them for 1-2 hours before they tell me I need to charge them again...

    I can use these in the shower, sometimes the water will change the song or adjust volume but overall works pretty well and I would say I got good value for money with this, also been using day to day at gym or around the house with no big issues.Apparently the quality of the microphones when on a phone call is not so great for the other person as I have been told, apparently it is clear but can pick up much noise quite loudly, which is both good and bad I guess.When they eventually expire I would buy them again unless I wanted something much higher quality.

    Convenient; acceptable value

    UPDATED REVIEWFound a Christmas Amazon gift voucher I'd put aside, and bought these earbuds on impulse.Well, perhaps not impulse exactly - I've been considering such things for the past two years.  Then I saw these at under £20 with a small discount.  My belated present was delivered a few days ago.  Sadly, sometime over the past few weeks - or do I mean decades? - I've become old.  First, I couldn't get through the shrink-wrap cellophane.  Broke two nails in the attempt.  Finally let out a war cry and attacked the packet with scissors.  Success!  Except the inner smooth cardboard box is of the drawer type, and lacking any method of pushing / pulling it out.  Oops, another torn nail.  I must remember to ask the GP to check my blood pressure!!!  Finally got into the package and extracted the instruction manual.  Which is written in microscopic print, surely less than 5 point.  Now - where did I put my specs and that magnifying glass???Having finally managed to decipher the instructions, I charged the box and earbuds.  Perhaps I'm not so far over the hill after all - charging them, and pairing them to my phone and mp3 player, was easy!I watched some catch-up TV on my phone to test-drive the buds.  The sound was fine, though I accidentally jumped to the previous episode while trying to move some hair out of my eye and put my specs on.  I was pleased to find other reviewers are right, and I can indeed wear my spectacles comfortably with the earbuds.After locating the reset button in the charging box, I then paired the earbuds with my less-than-up-to-date mp3 player.  Also simple, and works well.I listen to a lot of classical music, and like sonorous bass tones.  These earbuds are convenient if I want to listen while I'm doing something else - but if I'm sitting down listening properly, I'll stick with my wired earphones.  The sound on these is okay (can be really good, if only I can fit the buds correctly), but I have very narrow ear canals, and have to push them in uncomfortably hard - otherwise, I lose most of the bass tones and get a rather ""tinny"" treble.  Plus, the buds tend to work out of my ear a bit over time.  Shoving them back in is difficult without accidentally altering the volume or changing track!The tap buttons work well - if you can locate them!  Too well, sometimes: brushing a hand or coat hood against them can change settings!On the positive side - I love the lack of wires!  My wired headphones fit my ears comfortably, and have an excellent tone - but I'm constantly ripping them out of my ears when dealing with the laundry; dipping them in the water when washing up; tangling them round passing door handles / tree branches / etc when on the move.  These sit snugly in my ears and mind their own business while I'm busy with other things.I've always had a problem with earphones - over the ear, in the ear, whatever - the pressure very quickly making my ears very painful.  The right earbud continues that tradition - but amazingly, the left one is comfortable!  The over-ear loop makes the buds sit securely, and I'm not worried that they'll pop out and bury themselves in the depths of the dustbin, toilet, or wherever.Overall, good value, and adequate sound.  But perhaps not the best for people with very narrow ear canals ...

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2023,"







  
  
    The only ""issue"" I'm noticing with these is the bass is quite high but as I use these in the gym, it's actually quite nice. They fit really well, no issues at all with them coming out my ears and I usually have that problem. Battery life seems very good, both in the case and the buds. Overall I rate these very highly for the price, a perfect option for poeple wanting a cheaper set to use in gym, etc.

    I got these a couple of months ago to use in the gym. They arrived within the quoted  timescale and were easy to set up and pair with my phone. The sound quality for the price point is outstanding. Unfortunately, they aren't as good at resisting sweat in the gym. I found that after about 6 weeks, the left earphone started setting tracks back to the start every 30 seconds or so because sweat managed to get into the main body of the earphone. The case also stopped charging the same earphone - I don't know if it's an issue with the contacts or the earphone itself. A real pity because the sound from these was very good for the price.

    DECENT FOR THE PRICE
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 May 2023,"







  
  
    I have had (and lost) plenty of these type of headphones and these are the best of the cheaper ones I have had. They have the ability to use just  a single earbud as a bluetooth handsfree when I need the facility, and just one of these earbuds is plenty loud enough for this purpose. I also use them for running and they stay in place and are quite comfortable. The noise cancellation is more than adequate and the quality of sound is good. Volume levels are better than most.I really can't get used to the tapping sensors for volume control and pausing/answering calls. They don't seem instantly responsive and it does get frustrating. Hard buttons for me everyday.For the price, these are definitely worth a puntUPDATE 27/9/23As usual, I lost one of the earbuds and bought a second pair, thinking I would have a spare left earbud. This was not the case as they I couldn't sync the older earbud with the newer ones, even though they were the exact same model. Not too long after I bought the second pair, the left earbud just stopped charging. I cleaned all the charging points and did a reset - all to no avail. I then had  an older left and a newer right earbud, which I could only use one at a time! And now, the newer right earbud doesn't charge! And the remaining left earbud constantly disconnects from my device.My advice would be to avoid these and look at buying a decent set from a known brand, as these cheaper ones probably work out more expensive in the long run.

    Best so far
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2023,"







  
  
    I've tried over 20+ headphones in a span of 15 or so years, using various inexpensive brand (except for the likes of Apple or Bose, Marshalls etc. due to my budget) and these are the best that I have found. The Bluetooth connection and sound quality is the clearest I have experienced. They are light weight and easy to clean - not bulky at all.The charge doesn't take a long time. I tend to use 1 earphone at a time and it doesn't effect the sound quality.I don't use the app, as I don't personally find the need to. A pop up appears with the battery percentage and stating either right or left ear bud, once connected to my phone - this is without downloading the app.These are the second pair I've brought and gifted to my brother after purchasing my personal pair from Argos. They are the same price (at the time of purchase), it was purely for the convenience of next day delivery via Amazon. In my opinion, these are genuine JBL, just as the pair I previously brought from Argos.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2023,"







  
  
    As someone who gets a lot of enjoyment out of listening to music, I was very careful as to which headphones I would buy, although I am happy to confirm that these headphones are excellent sounding headphones. For the price I paid for these, I wasn’t sure how the sound quality was going to be, However I’m happy to report they sounds fantastic!!! The case is very small which was another one of my priorities as I travel a lot and I don’t want my headphones to take up a lot of space in my pocket, I feel these headphones are the best bang for your buck on the market. I would absolutely recommend this to anybody.

    Quite small....
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 May 2023,"







  
  
    These earbuds look nice, and the sound quality on the whole is pretty decent. There's a reasonable amount of bass when they're stuck in my ears but, unfortunately (for me), they don't really stay in my ears very well as the actual bit that sits in there isn't very big. I could do with something a bit bigger that's more snug. If you've got smaller ears than me, these would probably be quite good.The other minor issue is that these aren't supported by the JBL app; if you want to make any adjustments to enhance your listening experience through the app, then these aren't the earbuds to buy.

    Take's some fiddling about to get working!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2023,"







  
  
    Since my original review I've spent some time with these little beauties and I've now upgraded my STAR RATING from 3 to 5. Sound quality is pretty good on the bass and treble. Volume good. I reckon the original review was a little harsh but I now feel I understand why only one earbud worked at a time and I can manually switch off/on either as desired by simply holding (with a finger) for more than 2/3 seconds. Groovy baby...Got the package on time. Neatly packaged. Instruction manual too small. Needed a mouse to read and verbally advise!!! Haven't got one of those yet.First time out of the box (charging case) display indicated the charge at 100%. Put back immediately and charge dropped quickly to 92% (Confusing) - not plugged into mains.Decided to pair with my mobile but only Left earbud worked. Disconnected and placed back into charge case.Tried to pair with my PC (Windows 11) and this time only Right earbud worked. Disconnected and placed back into case.Re-tried the mobile, this time only the Right earbud worked!Put both back into charge case for an hour (or two).Took both out of the case and monitored the pulsating light of each earbud (trying to pair). The pulse of R was 3x to that of L. Tried pairing to the mobile. Both lights went out when paired but sound stronger on R to that of L.Reverted to PC. NB: You cannot pair to multiple devices at the same time. You must disconnect again from mobile before moving onto another pair. As sonn as I disconnected the PC paired up.Used Windows 11 Settings and Advanced Sound (Volume Mixer) to test further. Setting the basic level for the app to 60% improved the balance between the 2 earbuds (L&R).Didn't note any Noise Cancellation in effect! Only increasing volume seemed to cancel outer surrounding noise levels.Moved back to 'mobile' test. Disconnected from PC and got audible confirmation. Connected to 'A90 Pro' via mobile and confirmed connection for Audio & Calls but, no sound on play back through Apps.Looks like another reset. There is a serious issue with the firmware within these little devices that needs serious attention to be considered.Returned to testing again today. The pairing continued with the mobile with (L)&(R) both working.Testing extended to features as detailed: Volume, Jump Fwd, Jump Bck, etc all worked. Touching the earbuds is a bit sensitive. Also, Siri volume way louder than the level set by which ever technology.These earbuds are not really ideal for Sports. The slightest inbalance and they will fall out so I don't see any point in testing them for sport activities whether jogging, gym, or even any activity beyound sleeping and walking!As for the phone use and microphone, again, I won't be testing as I have no need for that use. Purely listening to so I haven't got to hear the kids but, yet gain the Noise Cancelling doesn't work.

    Great sound and price
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023,"







  
  
    I've used most day for 6 weeks now.Pros - The overall sound is good, deep bass and crisp highs. At medium volume levels they cancel almost all outside noise.At the moment the battery life is good too, I've only had to fully charge the case once and I use about 1-2 hours a day. (5-10 a week) The case clearly displays battery levels is very handy. That said its still early days.Cons - The ear buds were all too big for my ears, to the point were they hurt my ears. I had to use some from my old headphones. I don't have small earholes.My biggest gripe are touch controls. For me they are counter intuitive. Press and hold for 1.5 seconds to skip track and double tap is off/pause, it may not be an issue for you but it should be the other way around. There is also about a half a second input delay when you double or single tap to adjust the volume which can be a little inconvenient when you're out and about when your finding a track or you need to hear something else such as a travel announcement.Overall they sound great and for the price point it outweights the negatives. Yes, there are better headphones but I think you're getting deminishing returns the more you pay.

    My Microsoft Surface headphones where dying of old age. And i thought I'll give a try to earbuds. Never had those and not sure what to expect. But then for that price you can't go wrong. Or do you?I have unusually shaped ears thus headphones where alway difficult for me to get used to. Same here toi. Regarding of how would i put them in, or change rubber, there's always feeling they will fall off. Thus constant adjustment and trying to fit them better. And for first few days i was accidentally put volume down / uoyor pause music or skip to another track... Fun times until you learn how to properly grab them if you need adjustment.Pairing was bit awkward as there was no ligt indicating buds ready to pair. Though its duw to no juice but that wasn't the issue. After few days and cew more trying it just decided to work. It does takes a while for Bluetooth to discover them once they are out of case. Tried on pc, raspberry pi and MBA. Same results. So its definitely buds. Ill say uo to 2 minutes for them to be visible once you take them off from case.Charging was not an issue. Used power charger that came with my mobile. First i charged case, then inserted buds and job done. Music wise?I went from Burzum, through Meshuggah, Sun ra... Many different genres and types of music. There's good side and bad side. Some sounds good, others lack in vocals. Buds are nit heavy in bass so you will not get headache by listening to Blutonium Boy or Westbam. Listening to jap punk is also a joy. But if you're fun of BMTH well sad news. You can hear had bad he is on vocals.You want to know what they are capable of? Listen to Clown Core Computers. Or even better Confusion Pump Panel. From Blade. This is where they shine. Quick response, great swap from lo to high and back.Why 4 stars? Not sure where or how you do noise cancelling. Also if you coming from on ear / over the ear headphones... It takes time to get use to buds.Quoting Borat - I Like.

    Ok, so these just arrived and i've had fun playing with them. The setup was pretty easy, not quite how it says in the manual but got there are a false start. The bass is surprisingly good for price. Noise cancelling us decenr, blocked out my dogs having a yap anyway. And, they are comfortable and fit really well- simething I've had trouble with in the past.So, why not 5 stars? In brief, false advertising. These are advertised as waterproof. But theur manyak ckearly states do not place in water and that they are ""slightly"" waterproof, suitable for use when sweating. What they meant to say then is water resistant. Not a big issue but might be a deal breaker for some people. Additionally, the packaging says 30hr play time. Advert and description says 36+ hours. Which is it I wonder? I'll soon find out im sure.Anyway, for the price I'm happy so would still say buy it if you want budget buds.

    High-Performance Wireless Earbuds: An Honest Review
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 October 2023,"







  
  
    I recently purchased the Btootos Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3, and they have mostly exceeded my expectations. These earbuds have quickly become an integral part of my daily routine, and I am mostly thrilled with their performance.Let's start with the sound quality. The deep bass and stereo sound these earbuds deliver are nothing short of amazing. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio quality is crystal clear with rich, immersive sound. It truly enhances my listening experience.The active noise cancellation (ENC) technology is another standout feature. It's very effective at minimizing background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in whatever I'm listening to. For most situations, it's like having a personal sanctuary of sound.However, there's a slight drawback when it comes to the earbuds' performance in very noisy environments. While they excel in most situations, they can struggle to maintain the same level of noise cancellation in extremely loud surroundings. In these cases, some background noise does seep through, making it a bit challenging to hear clearly.The four built-in noise-canceling microphones are generally good for calls. I've had many clear phone conversations in normal noise conditions, and the people on the other end of the line have also noticed the improved call quality.Battery life is still a strong point, with 36 hours of playtime on a single charge, and the Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity remains reliable.In conclusion, the Btootos Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3 deliver excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation in most scenarios, and impressive microphone performance. However, they may not be the best choice for very noisy environments where some background noise can still be heard. Despite this limitation, these earbuds have become an essential part of my daily life, and I'm generally satisfied with my purchase.

    Better bass than my Bose 35ii
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2023,"







  
  
    So... What was I expecting from the A90 @ £18... Not this, thats for sure!SOUND: The bass has more punch at full volume than my Bose 35ii. I don't know how. But they do. Tested Hz range response from 18,000Hz to 24Hz. The sound balance is also very impressive, the clarity, vocals and bass all seem slightly better than my 35ii. Those headsets go for £399. Now we have covered the sound a 5*, let's move onto the rest. COMFORT: Very comfortable in the ear, and stay put, should be ideal for the guy or running 4.5*. RANGE: I've tested leaving my phone in the loft in 3 story house and worked fine on the groud floor, 10 meters with not so much as a hickup. TOUCH OPERATION: Intuitive and relatively responsive, with low accidentally touches. AUDIO DELAY: Non noticeable, tested on YouTube and Netflix. BATTERY LIFE: Not tested. Overall, they stand up to my Bose 35ii at £399. I cannot recommend them more at this price.

    Great design and extremely reliable
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2023,"







  
  
    I bought four. They are designed so well, and the earbuds fit neatly into the, pleasingly round and robust, case. At 20 sovs, I got several for myself and a couple as birthday gifts. I'm with the vinyl generation but I love MP3s FLAC files and small tech like this. I'm no audiophile so I can't pretend to be an expert, but these ear-buds and mega convenient, super compact and they sound great with both music and radio chat. There is certainly enough bass so the sound doesn't sound like it's coming from inside a Coke can, as can so often be the case. I've never worried about charging. They seem to last forever. I use one pair with my mobile and another with the PC to watch movies and videos. There is a lag of about 400ms with video but this can always be corrected by using the ""J"" and ""K"" shortcut keys in VLC - I find that just tapping the ""J"" key several times, to bump up the audio delay to -400ms usually does the trick. The ear-buds connect automatically so all I have to do is take the left one out of its box, and the PC (W11) connects automatically. The mobile connects in the same way. Then the moment you put the earbuds back in their case, they disconnect and the sound source reverts to the default. The price fluctuates with regularity but they are around 20 sovs every couple of weeks, so maybe watch, wait, then buy.

    lives up to the hype and good reviews
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2023,"







  
  
    My old inexpensive inner earphones gave out after a couple of years. Looked for a new pair and this was one of those amazon recommended or what have you so I checked the reviews. Seemed mostly good and the reviews re sound quality and bass were of interest. I did have quite a lot of scepticism as I have read how good the sound quality is and how deep the bass is on other inner ear bluetooth inexpensive sets were and they were not in fact very good. Not bad but not good. Got these ones through and immediately started to test them out on a range of music... classical, rock, pop, alternative and wow if they were actaully very decent with the depth of sound and tone. Clear, great bass and the noise cancelling is not bad... not great but I can listen to them with the mower going full blast and these are NOT on full volume... so good in fact I bought a second pair (I like a backup and have one for travel and one for home). Not disappointed at all.

    So happy with these!!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023,"







  
  
    After trying a well known brand where I just couldn't get both buds to pair after so much faffing and reading and re-reading the instructions, I bought these little beauties!  They are SIMPLE to use and great sound quality for my purpose (not a music buff, mainly listen to the radio, talk shows and Spotify).  I LOVE the fact that they charge in the case, that you can see how much charge is left and that you just take them from the box and they pair instantly.  No faffing, simple, cute to look at - just perfect.  I bought the white and my daughter bought the black and she was waxing lyrical about them too!  (We weren't even aware that we had both bought the same ones after loads of searching for the ""ideal"" earbuds for our Samsung phones).  Love love love.

    Initially thought these were the best thing since sliced bread but after 1 day the right earpiece stopped working and then after three days the left one gave up the ghost as well. Also had trouble trying to get the earbuds recognised on any blue tooth devices and the ear fit was terrible. I bought these for the gym but after 5 minutes on the treadmill they kept falling out of my ears. I guess you get what you pay for.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2023,"







  
  
    Working with a monitor and a host of peripherals during my workday has always been a bit of a dance - unplugging and plugging back in depending on the task at hand. This dock caught my attention with its comprehensive port variety. Upon arrival, I plugged in the device and watched my chaotic setup come together instantly. Quick charging of my laptop via the docking station is an added bonus, eliminating the need to use the laptop's charger. What really stands out, however, is the data transfer efficiency. My peripherals, previously hampered by outdated ports, now work much faster, increasing my productivity. However, be warned – make sure your laptop is compatible before purchasing!

    If you love paper products -- paper, pens, ink and desk accessories  in my opinion. you'll probably enjoy these envelopes.In today's cheap paper-manufacturing climate, where most bulk envelopes are so thin you can see through them, and so-called 'good' writing paper feels like T.P.  and the quality of paper goods seems diminished, these envelopes are thicker than most store-bought choices, silky and substantial to my touch, and the glue on the pull off strip actually holds.  I'd certainly buy these again and would recommend them to friends. Quality says something good about the company that produced these.

They have a lot of features that make them stand out from other envelopes.First of all, they have a window-less front panel, which gives me more privacy and flexibility. I can write or print the address directly on the envelope, or use labels if I prefer. I don’t have to worry about the window showing the wrong information or getting damaged in transit.Second, they have a super security tint pattern, which protects the contents and sensitive information from prying eyes. The pattern is very subtle and elegant, and it does not interfere with the readability of the address. I can mail confidential documents, checks, invoices, statements, and more with confidence and peace of mind.Third, they have a quick-seal closure, which is very convenient and reliable. The self-seal adhesive strip is very strong and easy to use. I just peel off the protective paper and press the flap down firmly. The seal is complete and secure across the entire width of the envelope, and it won’t open or tear easily. I don’t have to worry about using moisteners, glues, or tapes.Fourth, they are laser and inkjet printer compatible, which saves me time and hassle. The envelopes are premium quality and measure 4-1/8 x 9-1/2 inches, which fit most letter sized and larger documents. They are also smooth and crisp, and they work well with both inkjet and laser printers. I can print the address and logo on the envelope with ease and accuracy.Fifth, they are made with EnveGuard technology, which shows the company’s commitment to quality and safety. The envelopes are made from the best and safest material on earth, which is eco-friendly and durable. They are also approved by a team of engineers and developers who ensure that the envelopes meet the highest standards of performance and security.I highly recommend these #10 security envelopes from Aimoh to anyone of my friends who is looking for a secure and professional way to mail their documents. They are worth every penny, and they come in a 100-envelope pack that lasts for a long time. They are the best envelopes for secure and professional mailing!

    These security envelopes are great!  Perfect size for regular sheets of paper folded in 3 sections. You can't see what's inside. Closing and sealing the envelope is simple using the pre-installed sticky edge. Just peel and stick.

    I needed some new earphones to replace my old Bose that were 5 years old.I didn't want to spend the £270 for the AirPods Pro - these are the closest thing to it for an iPhone user for £100 less!Because they are owned by Apple and they use the apple chip, they connected just as easily with iPhone as AirPods.I love this blue colour.The sound is very good.Comfort is great - I use them for running and never feel that they will fall outThey are water resistant - one fell into a cup of coffee for a few seconds but it didn't affect the earbud (phew!)The tapping is very good - you press once to pause or start. Press twice to go to the next song. You press and hold to switch from ANC or not.What is clever is that the first earbud you put in (left or right) that is the earbud to which these presses are assigned i.e. it doesn't matter if you are left or right handed.The only downside is the noise cancelling isn't great - the airpds are definitely quite a lot better, but to be honest, it is definitely noticeable and makes a difference when you're on a train and wanting to watch something.The other downside is that the case can easily open - there isn't a strong magnet like the airpod case. if you intend of hooking these to jeans they I would buy a case cover that has a clip to keep it shut.so for £100 less, this is great value especially for iPhone users.hope that helps.

    Quality sound, battery life and great connection
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    I've had these over two months now, I use them for work/gym and they're fantastic. Worth noting that they can start to cause discomfort if worn for a few hours due to the little arm that hold them in your ear but to be fair, I don't believe they're meant to be in for several hours at a time.Good battery life and quality sound. Also great memory, when you put them in your ear they automatically come on and continue the music you last had on Spotify if you click them.ALSO NO DUMB AI VOICE, just 2 beeps to indicate low battery then they just die after maybe another hour of use.The fact they are designed as buttons and not touch screen is also beneficial, if you bump them and the music pauses, you could just use your shoulder to click them back on and not need to have a hand free to stick your music back on.So yeah, they're good.

    Unfortunately my first pair had some issues. The noise cancelling didn't seem to work at all and the right bud was not sensitive or responsive to the press down required to change volume, track etc. For this review I won't mark them down for those as that stuff happens.For the price I like the beats app you get to control the pods and it was so easy and seeemless to connect to both android and iOS devices.Sound is clear and product is robust and sturdy as is the great case which was durable.Are they worth £200...I'm not so sure. When I compare them to the apple pods they are somewhat inferior despite both being apple.All the reviews suggest the noise cancelling is good which is what made me think there was an issue with mine as it didn't seem to make any difference. iOS app seems to have a few more features than android.

    great quality and performance
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2023,"







  
  
    These earbuds work really well and work without issue when paired with an iPhone. The pairing process was easy as it prompted a notice on the phone when the earbuds were nearby. The noise cancelling is great and the transparency mode is helpful when I need to listen to outside sounds. I have found the sweat and water resistance to be useful when at the gym and they do stay in position without falling out of my ears even when running and shaking my head. Charging is easy and the USB C cable provided is convenient. The battery life is about 5 hours for me per charge. I would say the price is high considering it is getting closer to almost 2 years old at this point. The sound quality is great and the bass is good. Would recommend.

    Made by Apple so work like AirPods - but comfier!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2023,"







  
  
    I had AirPods Pro 2 but for some reason, no matter what tips I used, they wouldn’t stay put in my ears. I didn’t know that Apple had acquired Beats and make the Beats range but these have the same H2 and U2 chips the AirPods Pro 2 do so they do all the same tricks, including showing up in “Find My”, head tracking Spatial Audio, transparency mode etc etc. They have a better battery life and they are definitely louder - I thought it was the Apple software limiting the volume of the AirPods, but these are way louder! They also, for me, are a comfier and more secure fit. And cheaper!!! Highly recommended, even over AirPods. And the grey colour is so nice too.

    Great sound, but many annoying flaws
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2023,"







  
  
    Do not get me wrong, once the noise cancelling works, it is pretty good, the same can be said about the sound, even though these are stronger on the bass, which some people do not like. They look good and sound good, so why did I return them?1. The case - which on its own is not that big of a deal, but it has really poor quality. I have seen better cases being made for half the price of these - the hinges feel like they can fall apart any time.2. The BUTTON! - which is the most annoying feature on these, in order to properly fit them in your ears, as well as to utilise the noise cancelling feature, you have to push them into your ears, now the issue is that pretty much the entire surface that you are pushing on is the actual button, meaning every single time I would try to put them in my ears, I would accidentally press the button and music would start playing.3. The wings - The wings work pretty well at making sure the buds do not fall out. However, in my case, it would become uncomfortable to wear these after an hour due to the wing pushing against my left ear exclusively, but this will really depend on the shape of your ears.4. The noise cancellation - which sometimes does not work, unless the buds detect that they are properly located in your ears, which they were, and they still would not recognise, forcing you to remove them and put them in again (once again triggering my 3rd issue every time).5. The app - The app is great and responsive, even though it does not have much in terms of sound optimization. However, when it asks you to do an update of the firmware, the notification does not go away from your home screen until you do that. That would not be an issue once in a while, but within the first week of the purchase, this would already happen twice, forcing me to do the firmware update immediately in order for the notification to go away.At the end of the day, the main positive features of these are sound and noise cancellation. However, just for those alone, I could not justify paying double the amount that my current buds (Samsung, probably 4 years old at this point) are worth, which do not come with any of the issues mentioned, but their sound and noise cancellation are ""only"" 90% as good as these.

    The default gym earphones choice
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2023,"







  
  
    It has been hard to find a good pair of earphones for the gym - having researched an honestly ridiculous amount and bought way too many headphones I had to end up spending a bit more than I wanted to buy these but after the struggle I can confidently say that they are what I would consider the default choice for gym earphones if you want something that stays in your ears, blocks out most external noise, is stable/relatively comfortable and gets you pumping in the gym. The only downside (apart from the price) is that I cannot have these in my ears more than 3 hours but no gym workout should last that long. They are more stable than AirPods (don't recommend for the gym) as well as most other wireless earbuds I've bought (Jabra Elites, Sonys, other random brands on Amazon). The eartips work well to prevent shifting within the ear when running. The competitor is the Powerbeats pro which I was preferring until I realised how old the tech was - I think this is most likely going to be a better solution for most people. If you are concerned about the stability in the ear vs the Powerbeats pro I wouldn't be concerned - these are highly stable with the eartips alone and I would wager are more stable as I found earbuds with loops tend to shift about when running historically.

    Great headphones with exellent noise reduction.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2023,"







  
  
    Headphones have a premium feel and come fully charged.The display is clear and shows the charge percentage of the battery and the case.Once paired, they are instantly connected to the device when taken from the box. They keep the connection very well and don't disconnect, unlike my previous buds.Sound quality: brilliant! Very clear even on high volume. Almost as good as my Samsung earbuds, even the bass is punchy on high volume.Very comfortable for my ears, but I understand it can be subjective.They have a Type C port, so I am sure support fast charging.I had them during the flight, and the noise reduction is excellent, although not fully noise-cancelling, but the price is astonishing.I am absolutely delighted with the product. Great VFM! (I paid £15). Highly recommended!

    I bought these to replace the perfect £20 set of earbuds that sat in my ears without me even noticing them, and left them in a hotel room. This pair is nearly as good but even less expensive. The sound is good but they seem to be slightly larger with longer stalks and I am more aware of them.  So if you have big ears, they may be better for you as they will not fall out.

    Bargain Easy to Use Bluetooth Headphones
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2023,"







  
  
    These arrived the next day and had enough of a charge in them to try them out straight away.I've had a number of Bluetooth headphones over the years and these were one of, if not the easiest to link to my phone and get going straight away.Love the battery indicator on the box to help easily see when they need recharging.Also, I find them comfy to wear.All in all, I would but these again and probably will for my little sister.

On an aeroplane it was difficult to hear even with volume high.They are great value for money for every day use

    Excellent product
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023,"







  
  
    I wasn’t expecting too much from these earbuds because the price was so low, however I am very impressed at the quality which is almost equal to expensive brands. The casing has a similar flip up lid where they can be stored to charge and a pleasing feature is a charging display which enables you to see how much charge is left . The sound quality is great and you can turn off and on, sound up /down by touching sides of ear buds. All in all a great purchase!

    When I ordered these earbuds, I didn't expect them to be so good, either in style or performance. I'd only used Bluetooth headphones before, so was expecting these earbuds to sound tinny: I was wrong! I listen to classical music, and the tonal ranges are balanced. I've dropped them on a few occasions on a hard surface, and they still look and sound pristine. I'm very impressed with them so far.

    It is very rare for me to rate any product five stars, but in my opinion these earbuds earn that accolade. They tick all the boxes for me : comfortable to wear, easy to use, they automatically connect to the last paired device, show remaining charge on the small storage container and lastly excellent value for money.

    The original apple EarPods always fell out of my ear. I bought these to see if the pros would fall out without paying £300 for a pair of the originals. They are so good I don't think I will buy the apple version - ridiculously comfortable, never fall out even when on the treadmill or jogging. I can't really judge the sound quality as I'm quite deaf but they are perfect for audio books and TV shows. Havent even charged them yet the battery is so good. Can't believe the price.

    A Premium Audio Experience at an Affordable Price
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2023,"







  
  
    I recently had the opportunity to try out the A10 Pro Headphones, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in every way. These headphones offer a premium audio experience at an affordable price, making them a fantastic choice for music enthusiasts and anyone seeking high-quality sound.Upon receiving the A10 Pro Headphones, I was immediately impressed with their sleek and stylish design. The build quality felt sturdy and durable, giving me confidence that these headphones were built to last. The attention to detail in their construction is evident, making them visually appealing as well.Pairing the A10 Pro Headphones with my iPhone was a breeze. The seamless and hassle-free pairing process allowed me to connect them quickly, and I was ready to enjoy my favorite music in no time. The simplicity of the setup was a definite plus, as I appreciate products that prioritize ease of use.Once connected, I opened up Spotify and started playing some tunes. The sound quality of the A10 Pro Headphones blew me away. The depth and clarity of the audio were remarkable, allowing me to immerse myself fully in the music. Every note and beat came through with impressive precision, making me feel as if I were in a live concert.The noise cancellation capability of the A10 Pro Headphones is outstanding. I decided to put it to the test by asking my partner to engage me in conversation while I was listening to music. To my surprise, I couldn't hear a word they said. The headphones effectively blocked out any external distractions, creating a serene and uninterrupted listening experience.Additionally, I wanted to ensure that the headphones didn't leak sound, as I've experienced that issue with other headphones before. I asked my partner if they could hear any music coming from the headphones, and they confirmed that there was no audible sound leakage. This feature is essential for maintaining privacy and ensuring considerate listening, particularly in public settings.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the A10 Pro Headphones to anyone seeking a superior audio experience without breaking the bank. These headphones offer impressive sound quality, easy connectivity, and excellent noise cancellation. Their sleek design and durable build make them a reliable choice for daily use. Whether you're a music aficionado or simply someone who appreciates immersive audio, the A10 Pro Headphones provide exceptional value for money.

    Great price and work like new
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2023,"







  
  
    I've had these for a couple of months and they work perfectly despite being renewed. It's a great fit into my ears as well as my current Apple ecosystem!Obviously, you aren't getting these for their sound quality (even if they sound much better than previous models) but for practicality and everyday use, it gets 5 stars on that front.Spatial audio is a great addition which I mainly use whilst travelling on the underground. Fixed is fine but I find head tracking to be a novelty feature which does work but I don't normally use it. What's smart is that it remembers to switch between fixed and head tracking for different media. So if I'm listening to music it's fixed but if I watch a video it switches automatically to head tracking.If you want noise cancelling then look elsewhere. these aren't it. You'll have to pay more for the Pros or accept that you will have to get cheaper probably better-sounding earbuds but they won't have that Apple integration which you have with these.Can't control the volume from the AirPods which isn't great as I have an Apple watch I still don't need to get my phone out to change the volume...bear that in mind as can be annoyingSo yeah 5 stars for the overall experience using these headphones in my existing Apple ecosystem but I am not stupid enough to know there are better earbuds out there but none will work as seamlessly as this if you happen to own a MacBook, iPhone or Apple Watch.

    I bought these as my old buds had stopped charging properly. Although I didn't know the brand ""True"" I really only used buds to listen to my TV so for the price it was worth the gamble. Boy was I surprised. First of all the pairing was quick and very easy, no faffing about. Then the sound, it is crystal clear and really good stereo, almost a surround sound as things moved (on screen) left to right the sound followed. I have since tried using them with my mp3 player and again so happy with the sound. Using them with my TV for over 4 hours they still had power left, so I'm not sure how long they will actually play for. They arrived very well packed and for the price I honestly think they are a bargain, and would buy again should the need arise.

    These wireless earbuds with V5.3 Bluetooth offer a long playtime of up to 48 hours. They also feature an LED battery display, which can help you keep track of the remaining battery life. Bluetooth was very easy to connect. This can be convenient for ensuring you don't run out of power while using the earbuds. Perfect size can be fit easily in pocket. Charging case is best to keep changing for long time. Manual is easu to understand and so helpful.

    Ordered the Wireless Earbuds on the 4th and they were delivered on the 5th July, very efficient; have been using them for the last 40+ days and the right ear bud has gone into an intermittent charging mode ..Pros ..(1) very good bass and treble; the noise cancellation is sufficient to mask out external noises whilst being used in the gym.(2) supplied ear buds fits my ears ( select the best fitting from small, medium, large ) and the ear hooks provides additional confidence that the earbuds will not fall out during a run; both the ear hooks and ear buds were soft and comfortable.(3) battery life appears to be of good length; two hours in the gym and the ear buds were down to 90% as shown on the mobile phone.Cons ..(1) after about 40+ days, the right ear piece has stopped charging , the charge case is at 97% , the left ear piece is charging fine , but NOT the right piece.Cleaned all the contacts points, especially after gym use; tried multiple USB charging cables and USB chargers ; right ear piece is now charging intermittently ( makes me wonder if this is really IP 7 rated ), fingers crossed it will charge fully.Honestly, if it had been within the 30 day period ( unfortunately out by 10 days !! ), would have just returned it ; currently in communications with Seller .. watch this space for an update !!!In summary , this could be one of the best wireless hooked sports earbuds, but if it only last for 40 days ...Update as of 24th August 2023:The Customer Service Team has been magnificent; after contacting them regarding the faulty right earbud (appears that I may have been unlucky and ended up with a dud battery), they have sent me a new Q38 Wireless earbuds under warranty to completely replace the previous faulty pair.Just this Service and Support alone is worth 4+ stars and as previously reviewed above, these sports wireless earbuds are exceptional in their sound and comfort.Fingers crossed these replacements will last longer !!

    I was after a cheap pair of over the ear headphones and opted for these partly due to price but also the positive reviews. I'm not usually a pink colour fan but decided to try these having seen another picture review I liked how the colour was against the persons skin colour which is like mine. Pleased to say I'm actually really happy with my colour choice as they are a lovely light pink/rose gold.The earphone is like a smooth silicone feel which I love, I wish the case was the same but that's just personal preference. In my opinion if you have large ears these may be too small or uncomfortable behind the ear as the part that slots over the ear is smaller then I imagined.I easily paired these with my Samsung phone by putting on Bluetooth and scanning they came straight up. I have listened to Spotify, Amazon Music and the 4 App all without issues when pausing and playing.The sound quality I felt was fantastic, honestly as good as my Samsung buds. I have asked people around me whether they could hear my music when played at high volume and all said no which would have been a deal breaker for me if they could. The earphones charge when left inside the case and I like that it tells you how much percentage of charge is left also you can see the battery bars to indicate when they are fully charged.I've literally convinced everyone in the family to purchase these but there is one thing that I only discovered last night which has let me down and may be the only reason I might return these. I like to use them before sleeping in a dark room and I realised they have a really annoying flashing red light on both ear piece which was bothering me as it was flashing on the wall next to my bed. May not bother some but if my husband was laying next to me wearing them then the flashing would have definitely bothered me. Wonder if there is a way to turn this off can't see any information for this though. Shame as other then that I love them! If the flashing light wouldn't bother you then these are worth every penny but if it is something that would then look elsewhere.

    Great product, built to last!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 April 2023,"







  
  
    I was given a pair of these 2 years ago as a present and love them so much that I bought a pair for someone else's birthday.  PLEASE BEAR IN MIND: these photos are after 2 years of daily use so they look a little battered!  Obviously they arrived pristine :)For reference, I use these twice daily: one 1-3 hour use with a single bud, and one 1hr use with both buds), and once or twice a month for 4-5 hours with both buds.  They have definitely risen to the challenge.1. SOUND. I'm not a music buff so don't know how the sound quality of these would compare to more expensive or professional products, but I've found they produce well-balanced music at a high quality (i.e. no tinny sounds, decent bass) and no voice distortion in spoken word.  I mainly use them for audiobooks and they've been excellent.  If I'm in a noisy environment (I'm talking cooking with the extractor hood on, or the footie on TV husband-based commentary thereof, not a full-blown concert or anything) they do a great job of blocking out the room noise and delivering my own noise straight to my ear without having to have the volume deafeningly high.  They're not really noise-""cancelling"", but they negate enough of the unwanted noise for it to not be a distraction, and work well for my own purposes.2. DURABILITY.  As I say, I've had mine for 2 years and they have been put through the ringer; 90% of their use is outdoors on dog walks. I live near the beach so they have been dropped in the sand and dirt, sat loose (i.e. out of their case) in sandy pockets, generally been battered about and abused and they're still working perfectly.  The flexible in-ear parts can be easily removed for cleaning, if needed.The recesses in the case can be a bit fiddle to clean (though I'm not sure you'd normally ned to as I'm sure most people will treat theirs far better than me!) but a cotton bud and a quick blow and they're perfect.  The case itself is nice and sturdy and, even though I have the white version it still looks in good nick, especially considering the amount of dirt it's been dragged through.3. BATTERY.  When you first take them out of the case, a voice tells you ""battery fully charged"" / ""battery, about X%"".  I use mine for on average 2 hours but up to 5hrs at one time before popping back in the case and I've never had a low battery warning (I'm assuming there would be one in-ear if they got low).  Very occasionally I'll get a ""battery about 70%"" warning in which case when I get home I pop the case on charge and forget about it, but battery just hasn't been an issue for me and I've never heard lower than that.  I can't tell you how quickly they charge because I've never had to time it but the case is always fully charged after around an hour I'd guess.The 'case as a charging unit' is a fantastic design feature and really useful when on the go.  The metal charging connectors have never once failed, despite all the dust and dirt they've been dragged through.  The magnetic areas mean they snap back into the case perfectly every time, and they're definitely secure in there, even with the case open.  They also snap together if they're loose, which is useful if you've dumped them both in your pocket!4. COMFORT.  As they are relatively large, I'm surprised at how well they fit & sit in the ear.  The only time I notice them wiggling loose is if I'm gardening and spending a lot of time jiggling about with my head lowered.  And even then, a quick press and they're back in place. With normal, upright behaviour they stay in place for hours.  They are comfortable enough that you forget they're there.5.  CONTROLS.  I tend to just use the right one (I'm a woman walking alone so only have a single earbud in) which has the pause/play/skip chapter/answer call control.  It's a big old button (so very easy to use/no chance of missing it), works quickly, and when you restart it will usually rewind a second or two so you're not missing anything.  A long press skips forward to the next chapter/song. If you're listening to something and a call comes through, it knows to pause your music/book and automatically resume once you've hung up, so no faffing about digging out your phone again. Left earbud is volume control (single press: volume up / long press: volume down) and, again, is responsive and doesn't race through the volume levels too quickly, so you're able to adjust easily.6. OTHER POINTS.  Bluetooth setup was quick and easy (both on phone and laptop), and it connects quickly (another voice in your ear tells you ""bluetooth connected/disconnected"").  Charging is quick and simple: orange light on the earbuds when charging / orange light on the case and earbuds when plugged in to a cable. When first removed from the case the buds flash blue twice to show they're on and working, then some more blue flashes to show bluetooth connection status. There are various other flashing/colour combinations to indicate different things which are listed in the paperwork if you're interested. There's also some 3D sound system you can download (I never explored this) so I'd imagine you can tweak the levels if you want to.  The case design is lovely; it's smooth and rounded and feels pleasant in-hand.IN SUMMARY: these are excellent.  As I said, I'm no professional sound person, but if you want something that gives you solid sound quality, and will stand up to everyday use and abuse I would *highly* recommend these.  They're a good price for a quality little product and they're definitely built to last.

    Good earphones with amazing sound quality and fit.. ruined buy awful side buttons!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2023,"







  
  
    I bought a bunch of earphones from amazon within the same price range as this one to test them out and see which one sounded/fit best and this one was the absolute best out of them all.The sound quality and clarity is amazing, mind you i am a casual user and not an audiophile. They also fit surprisingly well for how bulky they are and you forget they are in your ears after a while. The choice of earbud replacements it comes with should cover most if not all people's needs as it did with mine.The battery life on these is also quite impressive but not as good as the TOZO brands as i owned a pair of TOZOs before and they lasted a bit more.All in all i have no complaints in regards to sound quality and fit like most people have however what really REALLY bothers me is the buttons on these earphones. Not only are they useless, they are also really frustrating to keep in your pocket. The slightest nudge or bump and the buttons on the side get pressed and they start messing with your phone. Another issue is that if you are trying to connect to another pair of headphones while you have these in your pocket it is practically impossible to do as they keep reconnecting because the button gets pressed really easily. So to fix this you need to take them out of your pocket and put them in the case which doesn't sound like too much work but doing it every day and every time you want to switch headphones it can become quite frustrating.I have also found that the gestures/button combinations they use for the earphones don't really make sense to me so i have not been using them at all.All in all i would definitely recommend these if what i mentioned above doesn't sound like something that will bother you.. But for me personally i would not buy them if i knew what i know now.

    Very good sound my only concern with them is I've brought four pairs and two of the pairs the left bud fails on two sets after a month or so of use. I am a heavy user 10hrs a day 5 days a week. The problem is the bluetooth failed and won't reconnect. I got in touch with Sony help desk and they told me how to reset them which works but in the end I was resetting them at least three to four times a day! Which is annoying.I know I know first world problems and all that!Got an exchange straight away but a 50% failure rate is a bit high for my liking

    I bought these for use at the gym and didn't want to pay a fortune in case I didn't get on with them.  They stay in place when running on the treadmill, keep out most/all the background noise when turned up to max, but I think they're limited to avoid hearing damage. The best sound quality is through the app using DSEE function otherwise they can sound a bit insubstantial but also can be customised with equaliser in the Sony or device music apps. A very natural sound.Fit is dependent on your ears

    **Review: Sony WF-C500 True Wireless Headphones**The Sony WF-C500 True Wireless Headphones have been a steadfast companion of mine for the past few years. While I've given up on splurging on high-end headphones due to my somewhat carefree nature (which often results in misplacing them), these headphones strike the perfect balance between affordability and quality. Their performance consistently impresses, delivering rich sound and reliable connectivity. Sadly, in a classic move, I managed to lose them last week, but that's on me. If you're in the market for dependable mid-range headphones, I wholeheartedly recommend these. Just maybe keep a closer eye on them than I did!

    I use this earplugs since May and I like it.I use it mainly for running, sometimes for a walk.It never came out accidentally, even if I did some hard sprint sessions/hills/off road mud stuff. But I checked every now and then if it's still there :D because there is a point where I can't hear or see  during my training exhaustion.As I mentioned it fits well, but I ordered another size of those small things to replace the original if I need to.I bought a second hand for £42 and honestly I can't spot any difference between these or a new one. I prefer the paid price than the original;) I would like to think I reduce the waste by buying a second hand instead of running to a shop and buy a new one. So I consider it is a win-win.Easily connects to phones or running watches with music. I really enjoy not carrying phone and a bunch of other stuff on my run. I have my own watch, earplugs and ready to go anytime.I never had an issue with battery. I had always enough battery for each training. I am out for 1-3 hours each time.  I never used whole day at work, so I can't talk about that kind of experience.

    Inclusive experince from a 3-month user
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 September 2023,"







  
  
    I'd like to share my experience as a 3-month user of the SONY earphones. They’ve been a great fit for my ears, although I did notice some minor discomfort after wearing them for several hours. The earphones work well in delivering high-quality music playback, and I'm satisfied with the functionality of the buttons for adjusting sound levels, playing, and pausing.In terms of connectivity, the Bluetooth connection is both fast and stable. However, there’s one aspect that left me somewhat disappointed, and that's the noise cancellation feature when using the earphones as a microphone. Unfortunately, it tends to pick up surrounding noise and sometimes diminishes the clarity of my voice during calls, making it challenging for the person I'm speaking to.

    Pleasantly surprised
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2023,"







  
  
    I was pleasantly surprised how good these EarPods are. A bit old fashioned and preferred to use wired headphones with a clearly visible microphone or hook over ears headphones when running as I thought EarPods will fall out of my ears easily when running or someone I’m talking to on the phone won’t hear me properly because the microphone will be tiny.Having recently had a hearing aid fitted to one ear, I took the bold decision to get EarPods. I didn’t want an expensive set in case my concerns were all true. Came across these EarPods and it looked like an entry level EarPods as the price was so low so thought to give it a try.And I’m glad I did! The sound quality is better than my wired headphones which was twice as much the cost. It fits in my ear perfectly and doesn’t feel like it is coming loose or falls out when I’m running. And when on a call, the other person says I come through clearly.It’s easy to setup and use. The charging case also looks look.

    Absolutely perfect
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    This product is just as described, and definitely rivals the bigger brands and for a fraction of the price. The earphones are comfortable to wear and don't hurt your ears/feel loose. They pair instantly as soon as you take them out of the case, and even the set up was an absolute breeze. You don't get instructions with them but there genuinely is no need as everything is so simple and straightforward to set them up. The volume and sound quality is good, as is the battery life. I wanted them for listening to music and for online meetings and they are absolutely perfect. The touch control buttons on them are really responsive and work well once you get the hang of where they all are. The case is a good size and fits well in a pocket without being bulky. I would absolutely recommend these if you are looking for a decent pair of earphones for a budget price.

    My i12 airpods arrived today and I am very impressed. I needed a replacement after my old trusty jacked in earphones that I've had forever had finally given up the ghost.They are small and compact with some brief instructions and a small charging cable. I managed to pair them up to both my iPod and laptop with relative ease. They have good sound quality and lots of touch features on them, which I still need to get to grips with, but it's all in the instructions on how they work.The sound and product is very very good for the price and I would recommend, as these are my first ever airpods and they're great without breaking the bank and spending a fortune.

    ​I recently purchased a pair of headphones and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with their performance. The sound quality is exceptional, with clear and crisp highs and deep, rich bass. The headphones are also extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Additionally, they come wireless and that allows me to move around freely while still enjoying my music without any disruption. Overall, I highly recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for a high-quality listening experience for low price.

    I like these earbuds. They are very  comfortable, nice and light. Looks just as in picture. Sound quality is great. It is very loud!  The charger cable in the box. It was not charged so I had to charge it. Easy to use and easy to set up. It works well and pairs well with your device, after first paring it connects anatomically. I have an android phone. Touch to turn off, auto power on. Does not fall out when moving around and when bending ect. Can run with them. Good battery life, I had them in for almost 2 hours. Great value for money and I certainly recommend.

I thought that you need to spend a lot of money to get a decent ones.I was so wrong!Can’t believe I’ve waited so long.These are seriously fantastic.Easy to use, feel great in my ears. I can walk around the house without losing the connection.And the price is so low!Can’t recommend it enough.

    These are probably the best wireless headphones I've ever owned.  Holds a charge for a very long time, you can listen for 10 hours straight.  Personally, I charge them probably once a week.  they charge quickly.  Connect immediately as soon as you take it out of the case.  The only problem is with the headphone app.  I can’t open it and see how much charge it has and change the settings.  maybe I just need to reinstall it

    I have tried many noise cancellation ear buds, and these are by far the best.I have tried Bose, and Sennheiser, and both have been over £100 +, and either the build quality has been very bad/easily breakable (Bose) or the sound quality v.bad (Sennheiser).I have used JBL products for a while now, and always come back to them. Although tailored for modern bass heavy music, I find that the acoustic response is very good, the noise cancellation is not perfect but a fair standard and they fit my ears well. For this price, I really cannot fault this product, and highly recommend.

    Definitely not the best earphones you’ll have but they do the job. Good quality for the price.Very good battery life!Things I don’t like: sometimes you take them out of the box and one of them don’t “wake up” just one connects to the phone so you have to put them back to the box and out again.The noise they make to tell you they connected to a device is a bit annoying, too loud.Something very good, I left them in my coat pocket and accidentally washed them 😂 I thought they were definitely dead and no! They still work! So probably not meant to be but they are kind of waterproof,I guess(?)

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2023,"







  
  
    I used to love my Soundcore buds, but after 3 replacements due to issues and decreasing battery life (only after less than 6 months), I was in search of another brand in the £50 or under range. Nothing fancy, just some buds I can keep in for most of day while I work at home . After testing handful of 'cheap' (under £20) wireless earbuds with very bad tinny/dull sound quality that I ended up returning, I factored that I needed to increase my budget. After careful research and reading positive reviews and watching video reviews that said great things about these JBLs, I took the plunge and purchased them. From the moment I took them out the box, and fitted them in my ears (very comfortably) and powered them on and played a song I was in awe of the sound quality, the bass booms, and the mids and highs are there, (this is BEFORE) I customised the App EQ. Also, the noise cancellation is amazing - cuts out virtually all background noise, and to top it off the battery life has been amazing. I think I wore them for 6-7 hours with a full charge, but could have been more. Either way, I'm happy with these buds. The only thing I have to get used to are the touch controls which are preset but give you the option to chose what you want the touches to do, but its something I'll get used to once I use them more often. The charging case is nice and sturdy, and you get 2-3 spare earbud tips in various sizes. If you are after a pair of ANC wireless buds in the £50 price mark I highly recommend these.UPDATE: September 2023.I purchased these earbuds in January 2023 and all was well and great up until I would say August or just before when the buds started to play upThe right earbud would not play.The right earbud not charging and battery life depleting as soon as put in earThen both earbuds not fully charging and having to retry a few times.Then battery life starting to get shorter and shorter after a full 100% charge.I don't know if this was just a faulty batch of earbuds or if this model is prone to these issues after a few months. The only way to find this out is buy asking for replacements/refund and repurchasing. If the same issues happen again then I will have my answer! Its a sham really as I while working properly in beginning I do love these earbuds. May do another update if I get new replacements. Watch this space!

    Decent for the price
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2022,"







  
  
    I have ASD and use earbuds on public transport, primarily to block out ambient noise.Until recently I've been using the  JBL 200TWS. I got them for a very good price and have been happy with their sound, simplicity and reliabilty. The only thing they lack is ANC and unless you play them at painful levels they don't block any background noise. ( I did manage to fit them with some Comply tips to improve passsive cancellation, but they won't fit the charging case).I've been looking at the 230NC since the price dropped but was wary of the number of reviews saying they were unreliable, so held out until the extended returns period started earlier this month.Soundwise, they offer an improvement in a quiet setting but on the bus they sound much the same as the 200's. Where they do offer a big improvement is in noise cancellation, with all but the most vocal of screaming babies being blocked. My only gripe about this is that it's not easy to turn ANC on/off without the app.They are also very bass heavy if you use the built-in EQ but I've now disabled it and use the flat setting in the Amazon music app which offers a more natural presentation.I really hope they remain reliable, as they offer a big improvement for me when travelling and are also enjoyable to use at home.

    Beside the fact that they keep charged for a long time, they offer a great sound. What is annoying is that when you receive a phone call, you have to reconnect them and to call back.

    These ear pods last a shameful 2 hours. My cheaper ones lasted me 3 days. The only reason I bought new ones was because one ear pod stopped working. I’ll buy another of the cheaper ones.I’m in dialysis 3 days a week 4 hours a day in a room with other people so having my tablet with movies or box sets is important to me. To have so called air pods that last 2 hours fully charged is not good.

    These have worked great. They fit the ear well. I've forgotten they've been in through hours of intense high-movement workouts a number of times.I've been pleased with how long they last.  Each one tends to last me several workdays.These kind of earbuds are going to be a lot less noise blocking than earbuds with rubber plugs, so keep that in mind. I'd consider these very open-ear. Good for being aware of your surroundings but not so great for blocking out other noises.

    Had them for a decent amount of time now and I love these!Bought them because I cant wear the other earbuds that go right into your ear...these are comfy and sit in place.Tap the left earbud 1 time to lower volume and double tap the right for louder.Double tap to turn on music or offHold right or left button to skip.They last quite a long time (I use them while working nights 10pm-6am) charge them for 15 mins (at midnight and 3am when I'm on my break) and they last all the way home too (about another hour)The only downside is the volume on the microphone...no one can really hear you well, unless you hold the left one close to your mouth, like you're holding a tiny microphone 🤣 even then...family has told me I still sound far away and a bit muffled.

    I don’t typically write reviews but I felt like I needed to. These earphones are actually amazing, it’s easy to connect, the battery for me last very long and the sound quality isn’t bad. I’m very into my music and use earphones pretty much all day. So sound quality was a big thing.  The sound quality is actually pretty good, for a product that is £17 the quality is actually amazing and is better than my old £30 earphones. I recommend you buying these they are very good 👍

     I lost my apple AirPods and my holiday was coming up so I thought I’d buy some cheap spares until they turned up. These came the SAME DAY as when I ordered them for starters. The sound quality is good, not as crisp as apple but very good anyway. No complaints there. They’re magnetic and stay secure in the holder like AirPods. They hold their charge far longer and they show you how much battery is left on the side when charging etc. the case is ever so slightly larger than apple AirPods but still very small and easily transportable. They connect to Bluetooth easily and they remember the device it’s connected to - a recorded voice will confirm so. Comfy in the ears. Honestly brilliant. I bought a white and a black pair for my partner and I would recommend these to everyone. Very, very good, much cheaper alternative to apple.

    Great headphones for the price!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2023,"







  
  
    Great for this price point, quick and easy to connect and I can be heard reasonably well on calls. The sound quality for the other person is still better when I’m not using them though, which suggests that the mic isn’t the best quality. I love that you can tell how much battery power is left and appreciate the little warnings that you get when they’re in your ears and the battery starts to run low. I’ve sometimes charged one earbud whilst I use the other, then switch over to preserve the power on a long phone call.I’ve also used these in the gym, which is where I have my biggest complaint. The sound quality is tinny at best and the volume doesn’t go up nearly as loud as it ought to, in order to drown out the general hubbub of other machines, people’s voices and the groans of those flexing their best over in the free weights corner! In fact, the volume remains so incredibly low that I don’t even bother to use these in the gym anymore!The verdict is: get these if you need a reasonably priced pair of wireless headphones for calls of an ok sound quality.

    Great budget earbuds but touch control features can be fiddly and over sensitive at times...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023,"







  
  
    I got these after the first pair I purchased gave up the ghost after less than a year of moderate use. Not wanting to pay a fortune, I chose these wireless earbuds on the basis of the reviews and the fact that they looked like they would fit in my ears (other earbuds are too big and continuously pop out!).I've had these for a few months now and so far I've had a fairly positive experience with them. Connection with my phone was quick and easy to do on initial set up, sound quality is actually much better than my previous pair and the case feels sturdy and well made.I wasn't sure at first what the information on the small LCD screen on the front of the case was representing, but I've since worked it out. The percentage amount in the middle is how much charge is left in the case, whilst the two bars either side show how much charge is in each earbud.I easily get 2-3 hours of almost continuous listening time before these need recharging, which is a simple process of popping them back in their case. I'm not entirely sure how long they take to perform a full charge, but I've recharged mine for about an hour before and managed to get another 45-50 minutes of listening time before they've needed charging again.One thing I particularly like about these is the voice confirmation that plays when the earbuds first connect to my device (a slightly robotic female voice states 'connected') and again when the charge is running low (this time the robotic voice says something along the lines of 'charge running low'). My previous pair just beeped at me which was sometimes easy to miss, especially if I was listening to music on a higher volume.As for the sound quality, for the price I think it's actually pretty good. Music and podcasts are clear and crisp with no obvious distortions even when played at higher volumes. I don't think they have noise cancellation properties but they do block out a certain amount of external noise when I have them in, which is fine with me. I prefer to have an idea about what's going on around me, even when I'm listening to music to try and drown it out a bit!I only have one slight issue with these earbuds, which is the reason for my 4/5 rating. I'm still struggling to get to grips with the touch controls. The main issue is the double tap function meant to pause whatever is being played. As I'm left handed, I naturally gravitate to the left earbud for this feature, but 9 times out of 10 it'll turn the volume down or off instead of pausing whatever is playing. It's almost like the earbuds are too sensitive and as a result interpret any touch longer than half a second as a long touch, which is the action required to turn the volume down (right earbud turns it up). As a result, I often have to resort to turning the volume up and down on my phone instead which kind of negates having this feature in the earbuds!Overall though these are turning out to be a pretty decent set of earbuds, especially for the price. It remains to be seen how long they'll last but based on the cost and my experience so far, I'd be happy to purchase another pair if/when the time comes.

    The charging pod is nice and small, more than portable without the bulk. The connectivity via Bluetooth is foolproof. The actual charge doesn’t take long and lasts for ages. The range is pretty decent too. I live in a first floor flat, meaning I have to go down a flight of stairs to my door/bins/car etc, and if I leave my phone in one of the front facing rooms, the earbuds remain in range, any further than a few feet away from my door and I struggle. Navigation is super simple too, but read the instructions because depending where abouts on the buds you tough, will affect the response. My only real gripes are that they are not noise cancelling, which was really the primary reason I bought them. As a woman with ASD, I always wear ear buds, regardless of if I’m playing music or not, and so the “ambient” sound is absolutely not for me; also they don’t feel secure in my ears, I can’t seem to find a satisfactory position for them, however that could just be my personal issue. Overall though, you get what you pay for, and for the value, they’re really pretty good.

    I ordered these specifically for the evening when young kids are in bed, babys asleep next to me so I can still listen to things on my phone without waking them. Have been working perfectly for that purpose. Clear sound, easy to charge.By chance I did attempt to receive 2 phone calls while these were connected. Although I could hear the other person clearly they said, on both calls, they couldn’t hear we well and had to disconnect earphones to continue the call.Work great for the reason I ordered them though and have been using them almost everynight for a couple of months now.

    Bought for my wife as usual shaped buds fall out of her ears, she has always found the apple I pod shape suitable, so bought these based on other reviews. She cannot believe how good these earbuds are, fantastic sound, lasted all week on holiday without requiring a charge, used for at least for two hours a day. She loves the fact the case charges the buds. Does take a while to get used to where to touch on bud for volume, track skip etc.I was that impressed I have now bought myself a pair, much lighter and more comfortable than my galaxy buds2 for a fraction of the price.

    I really like these so much so that I’ve bought another set to keep at work. They feel really solid and connect really easily and like that you can see how much the pod is charged. As other reviews mentioned they are a little tricky to get out of the charger as difficult to get hold of but you get used to that. Also the left one does seem to have trouble connecting occasionally but fine if you put it back in and out again or just always remember to take left one out first.

    The wireless hp are for the best part really good and value for money.  When I dropped them into water by accident despite not being waterproof they still worked fine. Sometimes the volume needs adjustment and you have to make sure both earbuds are wired for sound as it's easy to accidentally knock sound off one while other works. I would definitely buy these again as they are comfortable to wear and a discreet size.

    Despite what some people have said, these buds have a fantastic sound quality for music and phone calls. They are as good or maybe better than my Ap@le second gen buds. The battery life is good and the microphone quality on calls seems way better than some of the buds I’ve in this price range in the past.The thing that lets them down in my humble opinion, is the fatness of the charging case. It’s too fat to put in your pocket without it bulging, so I tend to only use these buds at home or if I have a laptop bag to put them in.The % Power display could be brighter, but I’m really being picky now.

    Good earbuds but easy to lose and not a step up in sound quality
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2023,"







  
  
    So I'm still in the middle of testing these but the short version is that compared to some cheaper wired together earbuds that I got more than 4 years ago these only beat them by having a lot more battery life and being able to tell how close they are to needing a new charge though only for the case. Sound quality is the same as is depth though the volume is very unweildly as for me it jumps much higher when I go from around 60-80% where one of those makes it so I can't really hear anything of the outside world. Oh yeah noise cancelling....no but I never expect that currently from any portal-able sound device.I have found the controls to be delayed or just activate when I brush them accidentally or do an different action all together which make me sorely miss the buttons on the wired together earbuds I have which are pretty nearly dead. Thing is they have the room for buttons to be put onto the buds compared to the earbuds I used in the past and I would much prefer them as I also found the delay to be so much so that I would need to wait a few seconds to allow for music to stop or for me to realize that I didn't trigger the sensor as there's no feedback.However when you are buying low you should expect there to be problems or issues which I did get with my wired together earbuds when I first got them and slowly got adjusted to them and learnt, I hope to do the same with these as their price is low and they do work for my phone which is more than I can say for some others I've tried where the the partnering bud wouldn't connect.When connected these to my computer the audio quality ended up being horrible like there was some bad connection or something hampering it, it was automatically set to max volume which when reduced did make the audio quality a bit better but still noticeable compared to my computer's headphone (but I did pay 100+ on them).These aren't suitable for anything more than casual use as the lack of ear hooks or way to secure them into the ears means that they easily fall out by even accidentally tapping them wrong or brushing them with clothing. Battery life is great though along with size of these and their case.....though the white version is not good as the display is blurred.

That is until I tried to connect them to my Samson Galaxy S22 phone. The phone could not see them at all, until I turned off Bluetooth on my Ipad. Then they connected immediately.So be aware ... I do not believe these are Bluetooth 5.3 as advertised.  They will only work on a single device at a time.

    Pretty GOOD 😊 VERY Happy with them
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2023,"







  
  
    Scroll half way through for my personal view on them.My sister was looking for cheap earbuds as she upgraded from her S8 phone. The new phones don't have a jack with them now.So for her birthday I got her these earbuds.They was in a lightening deal so was a little cheaper too. I decided to investigate the ""REVIEWS"" for these earbuds. As often you do find that the have a bunch of 5* all saying similar things. As if it was them reading a script.I found that there was a few people who had these earbuds and also had reviews for other earbuds too. It turned that they bought other 1s like this an then bought these as others had not been great.So it turns out that alot of the reviews are genuine and people's own experience of using them.*********My thoughts**********Very well packaged. They had good quality packaging, not as high quality as Apple Airpods or Galaxy Buds. As they're over £100.These are between £18-£25 depending on colour and the lightening deals on.They was simple to set up. They hold the Bluetooth signal very well. They don't have any noticeable lag with audio.They're easy to use on multiple devices. So if you have a mobile phone you use to listen to music and also a tablet then it's simple to switch if you watch a movie on the tablet etc.The case feels good quality too. Not massive in size, and not small and flimsy.The LED charge & battery remaining is a nice feature to have too. I use Galaxy Buds 2 and they only give the battery levels on my phone in the Galaxy wear App.Sound quality is surprisingly good.However, don't expect the same sound quality as other brands that cost between £100 & £300. That is not to say you will get bad sound as that's not the case.You just don't get the same as expensive Buds, things like noise cancelling, 360 sound, gaming sounds, an things like find my Galaxy buds or similar to apple airpods. For the price, occasional use if you went for a walk, the gym, or on holiday then these are fantastic earbuds.They are also good for using on a phone call too. They have a good mic and it was good quality sound on incoming voice as it was the voice quality on on the other person's side of the call.They have touch sensitive control as other expensive brands do.They do all the essential stuff you need like, answer call, end call, next track & previous track. There is more features but this requires reading the instructions, an they are easy to follow but there are some Chinese to English wording you have to try work out.They have a great battery life too. So I would definitely recommend these earbuds if you want a cheap pair that is good quality.Infact so good I bought another pair for my mum off my dad for their anniversary present.Hope this helps you decide too.

    Decent Sound And Good Range
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 April 2023,"







  
  
    These earbuds are around the 20 quid mark, so if you are looking for something that will provide for some serious hifi music enjoyment, look elsewhere or purchase some top end headphones. But for 20 quid how 'do' they sound? Pretty decent actually. Like all in-ear phones with silicone buds, you have to push them into your ear and achieve a 'seal' in order to hear stronger bass, and these buds give decent bass and also very reasonable mid and high tones. Using EQ on your device to enhance the sound is recommended.Bluetooth range is excellent: with my phone left in the living room I can walk all around the home listening to music without so much as a stutter.The battery life seems good. I listen to music for a couple of hours, sometimes after using them to watch a film, and they haven't ran out of juice on me yet. And they charge relatively quickly in their case too. And the case itself only takes around an hour to fully charge from zero.The charging case shows the percentage of its remaining charge in the centre, with animated battery icons either side, representing left and right earbuds. Initially I thought the battery icons would be illuminated according to the remaining charge of each earbud, but as soon as you insert the buds into the case, the battery icons light up in a sequential order from bottom to top in a continuous animation, even if your buds are 99% charged. When full, the battery icons remain solid. This was a little disappointing. Although my phone shows the power remaining for the earbuds when I connect to them, it would have been nicer if the case's battery icons reflected the earbuds remaining power, for example 2 solid bars for 50% etc.I like the way they auto connect to devices, such as my TV when I turn it on, or my phone when I enable Bluetooth. It sometimes doesn't happen though. In the case of my TV, if I turn it off to standby mode and back on, the earbuds will connect.The sound is good for watching TV, although a bit more clarity would be preferable. Once connected, my TV's EQ doesn't make a difference. But the buds are more than adequate for a late night noisy film viewing.Another aspect I really like is the triple tap to bring up your phone's voice assistant. I have smart plugs and lights in the home and have Alexa installed on my phone as the default assistant to control devices remotely. Tapping 3 times on either earbud opens up the dialogue for the voice assistant on my phone, doing the same thing as holding down the square home button on my phone's display, in my case it activates Alexa. So for one example I can get into bed, snuggle down with some cool tunes, and tap my earbud and tell Alexa to turn off the bedroom light.When you turn the buds on or off, and when they connect or disconnect, you hear a very loud female voice announcing the status. I find this a bit overly loud and wish that it could be turned down or disabled. When you are ready to listen to music and turn on the phones, you hear: POWER ON! PAIRING! And after connecting: CONNECTED!You can connect before you put the buds in your ear I guess, but then you can accidentally click to change the song or album etc. And if you fall asleep and lose your Bluetooth connection, or accidentally long press the bud as you lie on it, you will find yourself abruptly woken up with DISCONNECTED! POWER OFF! bellowing in your ear.Taps: tapping the earbuds provides the following actions:Single tap on left or right - pause/play.Long press on left - previous track.Long press on right - next track.Prolonged press on left or right - power off/on left or right earbud.Double tap on left - lower volume.Double tap on right - raise volume.Triple tap on left or right - activate your devices voice assistant.In summary: despite a couple of niggles, very good value for the price providing decent sound quality for casual music listening or film watching. With good battery life, speedy charging, very good Bluetooth range and voice assistant support is very welcome. Recommended for first time Bluetooth bud users or a cheap replacement for non audiophile listening.

    Likes:- easy connection- displays charge for both headphones on the front of the case- great sound- quick chargedislikesonly one major dislike, usually the earbuds i've bought in the past don't switch off unless they've been placed back in the case or if they're disconnected from a device for a couple of minutes. However, i find these headphones a little too sensitive, adjusting them in your ears (even a small touch) can switch them off completely which I've found quite annoying.other than this sensitivity, im pretty happy with them and would probably buy them again if i needed to.

    Brilliant set of earpods, just look a bit cheap
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2023,"







  
  
    I ordered them because of the good reviews and I didn't want to spend much on earpods, so they fitted the bill. Easy to use and sound is good (I'm not an expert and I use mine for audio as well as music) but I was a bit disappointed with the colour as the case of my rose gold version is not completely rose gold and has some white plastic side bids/panels which I find make them look a bit cheap/spoils the look. I know the sound is more important but it should look good too. It would have been better if all would have been pink as all the other colours have the case completely in the matching colour.  Hence only 4 stars from me. I ordered a white set too to decide at home which colour works better for me as it annoys me. I also find - because of the high side panels - they are a bit more fiddly to get out if you don't have long fingernails. But that's perhaps just me?! I returned mine as they always dropped out of my small ears.Otherwise excellent.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2023,"







  
  
    I'm impressed and grateful for nice solid buds at such a cheap price.They came with three sizes off ear piece and sit snugly.Very adequate sound at mid volume but perhaps a tad rattly when turned up to 11.Initially I thought the display was a fasade but it turns out all of it works on some level. However the power level readout seems very off. I've had them a few days now and it's reduced to 99% one time... Also, when I charged it back up, the right 9 flashed inexplicably ... Perhaps they're a faulty batch? They work well though.Note there is a small delay so gaming or video is not a good idea with these. Perfectly fine for music, audio book or radio though.

    Had these for a couple of weeks now and they have been great. Sound quality is great (used equalizer on phone to get it just right), with a good bass sound. Touch control works although I'd recommend a pinch rather than a touch myself. Managed to change the voice that says connected etc to english but not exactly sure how! (think it was about 5 quick taps on left bud when just switched on then heard the voice say 'english', search online for methods). Not vital to do this though as obviously they still worked.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

    Good bass, but bad high pitch
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 July 2023,"







  
  
    I bought this earbuds expeting a better aound quality, and since bass is normally the hardest part to get it right, I went for this one. And it certainly delivers... on the bass. For high pitched songs, specially j/k-pop, I though it was not so great. But is a fair earbud for the price, overall.

    Battery is nowhere near as long as advertised but sound quality is decent and the ear fit is fine.Worth it for the price, but I expect I will need to buy a new set in a few months

    Great sound, great price
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 August 2023,"







  
  
    Bought these to replace an older pair that I had misplaced. Initially just wanted for the gym as I wasn't expecting much for the price, however once receiving them I was amazed at the quality. Both the build quality and sound quality. I am since never without them.Often with cheaper priced earphones they hurt my ears after a short while. I recently wore these on a long flight and if it wasn't for the music, I wouldn't have known I was wearing them they are that comfortable.The sound was clear, with good bass levels too. Making videos especially immersive.The added feature of showing the battery levels on front means I never run low.Recommend these to anyone looking for quality sound at a fantastic price

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

    Definely value for money
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2022,"







  
  
    These earbuds are definely value for money.They are very compact and a good choice if you are looking for an acceptable sound at a good price.The outside of the buds fashion a little silver heart on each one and are reasonably comfortable once you have them in your ear right.They come in a nice box for presentation and are not packaged in the charging case itself but is packaged separately which when you open them gives them a nice presentation to look at.  They come with a nice, reasonably long charging cable but do NOT come with extra replacement earbuds of different sizes. The size that comes with them is all you get. For me I had to keep wiggling and pushing them in my ear because they didnt feel secure in my ear enough, but for someone else they may be perfect.They were easy to set up as you will see by the instructions, it took me seconds to get them working.The sounds on these are pretty clear and didnt hear no muffle or background hissing, they are not top quality sound but they are definitely a contender if you want good sound at a low price.I found that the controls for me were a little fiddly as they are on the stem which is running down the side of my ear, for me they would have been better on the top of earbud itself.  You can hear when you are controling them as you hear a little click with the tapping you do.Would I buy again? For me i probably wouldnt but for someone who likes good sound and hasnt much money then yes I would. These would definitely be good as a present for kids.

    Easy set up and decent sound
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2022,"







  
  
    I got these as spare earbuds, but have ended up letting my Mum keep them as she tried them and loved them!These earbuds are easy to set up on a phone.  It took me a minute or so to set them up for my Mum and show her how to connect them if she needed to in future.  The buds are fairly decent sound, obviously not as good as other more expensive buds, but if you want a cheaper set to try or just something for occasional outdoor use (say doing the gardening like my Mum) then these are a good value option.  Fit is very comfortable and they stay in place really well.  Battery life also seems good and holds charge well.Recommended as a good budget set of earbuds that have good sound and feel comfortable.

    A bit fiddly to use but great sound
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2022,"







  
  
    These were promptly delivered and were very well packaged. They worked straight out of the box and were easy to connect and use - to a point. Supplied instructions were straightforward.The sound to me through these is on par with slightly more expensive tethered bluetooth pairs I have had in the past. Trying most applications, i.e. music/podcasts and film, they sounded great for being averaged price buds. I had to adjust eq through my music app for best results in each application used aboveThe only downside for me was trying to skip tracks as it involves triple taps which I cannot seem to master while they are in my ear. They are sensitive enough to work but I assume that I am not holding them correctly when trying the different modes. This has always been problematic for me, even with tethered bluetooth pairs as I do not have the controls in front of me. One and two taps I can get the hang of. I don't think this a design fault, more user error.Although these are not your top end isolating earbuds, I was pleased with sound and will persevere with these. Worth a try if you are looking at something around the £20-£30 mark.

    It's okay but controls don't work
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2022,"







  
  
    The headphones come in a white plastic charging case. Nothing really to say about the case. It's just functional but looks ok. There are no markings apart from a small LED light to indicate charge status. The light will be orange when charging and green when it's full.The headphones look ok, quite basic and flimsy plastic white with some silver edgings. The headphones are budget so you can't expect too much. Again they look okay. Nothing special but nothing bad either. They are perfectly fine. I would have no problem being out and about with these in... In any case, it's not like people are going to be looking too closely at your ears!The sound is loud which is a plus for me. There's no base, which does not bother me, but some might be bothered by this. I am no audiophile so for me the sound was loud and clear.There are some problems with the headphones. I had the same problems as quite a few other reviewers. The controls don't work at all. Additionally the headphones and case seem very flimsy and plasticy. I am not sure how long they would last. However these are very cheap for wireless headphones so if the lack of controls don't bother you and you just want some clear loud headphones then you could consider giving these a try.

    Very compact!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2022,"







  
  
    Ok so I ordered these because the seem to be good value and have a small form factor.The are definitely nice and compact in its charging case and easy to travel around with.They were easy to set up and the sound quality was acceptable.not the best but definitely able to enjoy the music you love comfortably.Only thing I dislike is most of the pictures show the inside of the earbuds and not the outside stem part.The outside stem touch area has what looks like a mirror/metal look HEART which as a grown man I am really not a fan off at all which is such a shame.Aside from that I think the value for money is decent.just the hearts on the stem puts me off them.That is personal preference though and I could imagine there are a lot of people who would absolutely love it!If you don’t mind the heart I would recommend.

    Great pair of headphones 🎧
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 October 2022,"







  
  
    Given the price of these headphones, I did not expect the performance on these to be quite good 👌🏻I have only used Apple or Samsung airpods/buds and wanted to try out something different and I was quite impressed with these! Firstly these are affordable which is great and the colour is also quite nice and unique.The design is nice and compact and very lightweight too👍🏻these headphones in itself are quite easy to set up and use. These pair easily to your phone via a good Bluetooth connection. The sound quality on this is quite decent and what you would expect for this price. Depending on the outside, there can be fuzz time to time but nothing major. The battery life is also good, gave about 34hrs and will last you for majority of the day.Used it for gym and running outside as I like to keep myself fit. Notice cancellation is alright, I have heard better but works good.Overall not a bad pair of headphones. Would recommend.

    This is a great earphone I love everything about it the sound quality, the call quality and its comfortability but it sometimes disconnects and I have to reconnect again which can be annoying but overall this is a great product if you’re on a budget ans need a pair of great earphones

    Great sound quality but...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2022,"







  
  
    Read thoroughly 🟢 : These are so cute. Love how they look like, very posh!  When you open the case the earphones will tell you the power is now on... well the lady's voice is rough. HER sound quality bad. HOWEVER once they are connected to your phone and you listen to music OMG the quality is great!!! I've got no complaints about that and I'm very impressed with how powerful they are and how good they sound so that would have been a 5* on it own.However.... I've got a few reasons why not to leave a 5* review and I even debated if to leave a 3* instead of a 4*... ➡️-They look very much like the Apple ones. I've never tried that brand however I find these ines rather uncomfortable in my ears. It might just be a matter of getting used to them as the ones I currently use are of a different shape-The box they come in is plain white. Makes me think of a sort of fake product? Like why does it not have branding in it or something?-The case is lovely and small however it's very small in my opinion and it doesn't have any sort of loop/hook or anything that I could attach a string to it or something to hang from my neck when I'm out and about so I hope I won't lose them anywhere!-the box contains the earphones and case,  a type C wire and the instructions. There are no extra buds in it and the ones that come with it are SMALL. So again, I find them rather uncomfortable to wear. I tried swapping them for other buds I already had but they were too big and wouldn't allow the case to close so had to change back to the ones provided which is a shame.-the instructions are very basic. I don't know what I was expecting to be honest but my previous ones were more detailed. However once I turned the bluetooth on on my phone they connected to it straight away so no problem with that.This is my honest opinion so it's up to you to weigh what youwant from new earphones. Yes I made all the above points BUT don't forget the first and probably most important point I made... the quality of the sound is actually GREAT and in my opinion makes them a great product to have! I'm keeping them and enjoying some good quality music 😎

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2023,"







  
  
    The Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) in its Starlight Aluminium Case paired with the Starlight Sport Band is a testament to Apple's commitment to blending functionality with style. The watch's aesthetic is both sleek and modern, with the Starlight color giving it a unique and sophisticated touch that can easily transition from a workout session to a night out.Performance-wise, the 2nd generation SE doesn't disappoint. It offers a smooth user experience, with apps launching quickly and the touch response being as intuitive as one would expect from an Apple product. The GPS feature is accurate and reliable, making it a great companion for outdoor activities and workouts. The fitness tracking capabilities are commendable, offering a wide range of metrics that cater to both casual users and fitness enthusiasts.The display is bright and clear, making it easy to read even in direct sunlight. The raise-to-wake feature is quite responsive, and the haptic feedback provides a tactile experience that feels premium. The integration with the iPhone is seamless, and the ability to receive notifications, answer calls, and even respond to messages directly from the watch is incredibly convenient.However, the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) is not without its shortcomings. While it offers a plethora of features, it lacks the always-on display, which is a feature present in some of the higher-end models. This means you'll need to raise your wrist or tap the screen to see the time or check notifications. Additionally, while the battery life is decent, lasting a full day on moderate use, it might require nightly charging for those who use it extensively throughout the day.The Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) is a solid mid-range offering from Apple. It encapsulates most of the essential features that users have come to love about the Apple Watch series, all while being presented in a stylish Starlight Aluminium Case. While it might not have all the bells and whistles of its pricier counterparts, it offers great value for its price point and is a worthy consideration for those looking to enter the Apple Watch ecosystem or upgrade from an older model.

    The dumbest “smart watch”
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2023,"







  
  
    I knew Apple smart watches had battery life issues when I bought it, so that doesn’t go into the score, but compromises Apple have made to even achieve that paltry battery life makes the Apple watch a fancy kids toy, or a super niche use case.- It doesn’t do continuous hart rate monitoring, or not at any useful frequency.- It starts monitoring heart rate when it “detects” you are working out or you tell it explicitly that you are working out.- It does not expose gps control, so you can’t fine tune battery consumption- It does not detect automatic sleep posture. So unless you tell via the health app, when you are going to sleep, it won’t count any other naps as sleep time. There isn’t even a way to tell it that you are going to take a nap (or I haven’t found it).The super niche use case is if you give it to an elder in the family for fall detection. Even then the battery life will make it very difficult for such a person to use it independently without carer help. So again, kinda moot. Yes as a regular cyclist if you get bumped off the road by a car, that might be a useful scenario but no idea if it is triggered then.The only reason to have it is if you don’t want to give your data to Google or the dark web… (ahem I meant a certain company who got ransomwared recently)

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2023,"







  
  
    Bought the 40mm as I assumed the larger one would look too big on my wrist, however it actually is smaller than I expected so if I was to buy it again would probably go for the larger option. In order to set up the watch you have to have a relatively newer phone that is capable of updating to iOS 17. If your phone can’t update to the new iOS you won’t be able to use the watch unfortunately as it is running on watch OS 10. The wrist strap feels comfortable enough, would probably get the larger wrist strap unless purchasing for a child as the size S/M is a lot smaller than I expected! Works ok in the shower as it’s waterproof. No issues so far.

    Disappointing
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2023,"







  
  
    I love Apple products in general, but not this watch in full honesty:1) terrible at getting notifications. As much as I tried to go through iPhone settings and Apple Watch’s settings, I don’t get notifications or if I do at a random time.2) they are bulky.3) software appears to glitchy.4) if you don’t have c-charger input then you need to get one as you won’t be able to charge your Apple Watch with the cable provided.The good point for it only one, the moment you turn your watch on, your iPhone automatically recognises them (as long as your Bluetooth on) and permits you to do the set up.My opinion this watch is a waste of money. You could get HUAWEI watch which does everything what Apple does for a fraction of the cost…Lesson learnt.

    A subtle but smart upgrade for your wrist - Pros & Cons
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2023,"







  
  
    The Apple Watch Series 8 is the latest iteration of Apple's popular smartwatch, and while it doesn't look much different from the previous models, it packs some new features that make it worth considering. In this review, I'll go over the Series 8's pros and cons, as well as the reasons to buy or avoid it and give my final verdict.~~~ Pros ~~~1- Attractive new colours: The Apple Watch Series 8 comes in four new aluminium colours: blue, green, red, and starlight (a mix of silver and gold). These add some variety and personality to the watch, and you can also mix and match them with different bands and watch faces.2- Skin temperature reader for cycle and sleep tracking: The Series 8 has a new dual-sensor design that can measure your skin temperature while you sleep. This can help you track changes in your menstrual cycle, ovulation, and fertility, as well as detect signs of fever or illness. You can view your temperature trends in the Health app on your iPhone, and get alerts if your temperature is too high or low.3- Crash detection: It has improved motion sensors that can detect if you've been in a car crash, and automatically call emergency services and send your location to your emergency contacts. This can be a lifesaver in case you're unconscious or unable to reach your phone. You can also manually trigger this feature by pressing and holding the side button.4- New watchOS 9 workout interface: It runs on watchOS 9, which brings some enhancements to the workout app. You can now see more metrics on the screen, such as calories, heart rate, distance, pace, and time. You can also customize which metrics you want to see, and swipe left or right to switch between them. The workout app also supports new types of exercises, such as dance, functional strength training, and tai chi.5- Longer battery life with low power mode: It has a slightly larger battery than the Series 7, which gives it up to 18 hours of battery life on a single charge. However, if you want to extend it even further, you can use the new low-power mode, which turns off most features except for the time and notifications. This can give you up to 36 hours of battery life, which is useful for camping trips or long flights.~~~ Cons ~~~1- Battery life still lacking: While the low power mode is a nice addition, the Apple Watch still falls behind some of its competitors when it comes to battery life. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 can last up to two days on a single charge, and the Fitbit Versa 3 can last up to six days. If you use features like GPS, cellular, music streaming, or always-on display, you'll need to charge your Apple Watch every day or even more often.2- Identical design to last year: The Series 8 has the same design and display as the Series 7, which means it doesn't look very different from the previous models. Some users might have hoped for a more radical redesign, such as a round or square shape, thinner bezels, or a larger screen. The Apple Watch Ultra offers some of these changes, but it's also much more expensive and not widely available.3- Wish it borrowed the Apple Watch Ultra's siren: The Apple Watch Ultra has a unique feature that lets you activate a loud siren from your wrist in case of danger or distress. This can be useful for scaring off attackers or attracting attention from bystanders. The Apple Watch doesn't have this feature, which seems like a missed opportunity for enhancing its safety capabilities.~~~ Reasons to buy~~~- If you want a smartwatch that works seamlessly with your iPhone and other Apple devices- If you care about tracking your health and fitness metrics, especially your skin temperature- If you value having safety features like crash detection and emergency SOS on your wrist- If you like having access to a wide range of apps, watch faces, and bands for customization- If you don't mind charging your watch every day or using low-power mode~~~Reasons to avoid~~~- If you want a smartwatch that has longer battery life or faster charging- If you want a smartwatch that has a different design or display from the previous models- If you want a smartwatch that has more advanced features like blood pressure monitoring or siren- If you don't use an iPhone or other Apple devices- If you find the price too high or prefer a cheaper alternative~~~ Conclusion ~~~The Apple Watch Series 8 is a minor but significant improvement over the Series 7. It now includes new features that improve its health and safety capabilities, such as a skin temperature reader and crash detection. It also runs on watchOS 9, which improves the workout app as well as the battery life. It does not, however, change much in terms of design or display, and it continues to lag behind some of its competitors in terms of battery life and innovation. The Apple Watch Series 8 is an excellent choice if you want a smartwatch that works well with your iPhone and has a comprehensive set of features. However, if you want something more unique or more affordable, you should look elsewhere.

    Great watch and does nearly all that you need really well and links seamlessly to your phone.  The negatives are: battery life is a day at best with most functions turned on; there isn’t a WhatsApp app for it so you have to link it via a suboptimal third party app - not good given the use that is made of it today; finally the map function is just a turn indicator that works of your phones navigation.  Worth buying without a doubt, just with a little more effort Apple could have produced a stunning watch.

    Charges pretty fast, important that you charge and don’t let it fully die. Battery usually lasts a day and a half (I never take it off even when sleeping)Connects to everything fastBands nice but I switched for a custom one as I’m not fan of rubber/silicone style as sweat builds up a lot on it.Perfect watch for sports, syncs all health information to main iPhone health app and also a lot of other health apps.Basically the same speed as going through iPhone it has never lagged for me and had it over a year no problems so far.

     Yes, it’s very expensive.Yes, Apple own too much of my life.But yes, it makes my life so much simple.As a neurodivergent parent with other roles and responsibilities, having my reminders and appointments right on my wrist helps my busy brain to cope with daily life.Seeing notifications and being able to decide whether I need to deal with them straight away without checking my phone (and getting distracted by every other app I see and forgetting to deal with the initial notification) makes me much more productive.My previous smart watch had fewer features but didn’t work the way I had wanted - I really wanted the organisational assistance of an Apple Watch but without the distractions the many features would provide. It just ended up not working for me because it didn’t sync well enough with my iPhone. Having both my phone and my watch produced by the same company means I barely have to do anything in order for them to work together. This is an absolute blessing for someone whose brain hates instruction manuals and setup.The only downside I’ve really come across is the battery life, which is roughly a day. I don’t mind because I just have the charger next to my bed and charge it while I read, then it’s full when I go to bed and then in the morning I can see how badly I’ve slept.Also it’s really pretty. See how pretty it is? So pretty.

    It’s much more then a watch: a compass, a remote for my phone camera, a timer, a phone, and I could go on for some time. It integrates very well with the iPhone. I particularly like the ability to change straps and change the face and it’s colouring. Thus I can match it with almost everything I’m wearing. It needs charging every day or so but it really isn’t a problem because it charges so quickly. I have considered getting an iwatch for some years. I’m glad I have finally taken the plunge.

    Not worth the upgrade if you’ve already got an Apple Watch, unless you specifically have a health issue where you need to monitor your blood O2 level.If you don’t already have one, or if you need to replace one, this is great, and the price is good too.It is water resistant to 50m, has an always-on display, is great for fitness tracking and health monitoring, and allows you to check incoming messages etc. without having to get your phone out.The battery lasts all day, so it’s fine if you take it off at bed time, however, because it only lasts 1 day, completely useless as a sleep tracker.Overall, you get a lot for your money, and it’s really useful.

    Minor evolution over Series 7 & 8, but big improvements for those upgrading from older versions
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2023,"







  
  
    How often do you upgrade your smart devices? I upgrade my iPhone every 2-3 generations, the same goes for my iPad Pro. But what about the Apple Watch? I don’t believe the majority of people upgrade every year, or even two or three years. The incremental improvements to each generation of Apple Watch appears so minor that you’d struggle to see the difference if two successive devices were compared against each other.Which is why I’ve waited so long to upgrade from my pensionable Series 3. I’ve had it since shortly after its release at the end of 2017. 6 years is a long time for a gadget, especially one that is attached to my body every single day. But I’ve struggled to see the reason for upgrading, despite my Series 3 become less and less reliable over the passing years. The screen was sometimes washing out and made it difficult to read, especially outdoors. The finger gestures to swipe up and down rarely worked, and the crown dial was almost fused to the watch it was that difficult to move. The heart beat monitor was sporadic at best, and it was pure fluke that it ever recorded any meaningful data from a workout. Yet, still I wore it. Mainly because as well as telling the time, the haptics were brilliant and a more reliable way of knowing when a message or call was coming in than my phone which I have on silent and regularly put down and forget I’ve left it behind.I’d been waiting for a big development of the Apple Watch to tempt me into buying a new one. Every new generation improved all of the health tracking functions a little bit at a time, occasionally adding new things like sleep tracking. What I was really hoping for was a blood pressure monitor, something that Apple have submitted patents for but it still hasn’t made its way to the Watch yet. As someone who has migraines from an early age, I’ve found that a migraine attack often coincides with a spike in blood pressure so a means of tracking this might help in anticipating the next attack. It looks like I need to wait a little longer though for that functionality.Despite this still not appearing, I felt that Series 9 was the time to finally upgrade. The vast majority of this generations improvements are subtle. It’s got a new processor that is faster than the previous one, which is great but honestly how often to you notice the step up in performance? Especially on a watch that isn’t going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting processor wise. The screen is twice as bright as the previous generation, going up to 2,000 nits. I’ve certainly noticed that the screen is easy to read even in bright sunshine, at least compared to my Series 3 anyway. It also goes down to a very low 1 nit brightness, which is useful if you wear your watch to bed as a sleep tracker.There’s an improved Ultra-wideband chip which helps finding your other apple devices such as phones, earphones and smart trackers. Siri no longer needs the word “hey” adding before it’ll wake up to your requests. But, generally, there aren’t many ground breaking improvements.The battery life is still as unremarkable as ever. Compared to most other smart watches the Apple Watch has always been pretty poor. Long-time users will be well used to this, and will have developed their own way of managing the battery, but new users may be disappointed or shocked at the battery life on an Apple Watch. Apple always claim an “all day” 18 hour battery life, and in fairness is based on plenty of use during the day, but it’s still less than impressive. The obvious way to manage your battery is to charge it every night. Take it off your wrist, put it on a bedside charger and it’ll be good to go when you wake up in the morning. But, what if you want to use it as a sleep tracker. The Apple Watch is actually really good for use as a sleep tracker, and gives you a lot of interesting data about your sleep patterns…but when do you charge it? I personally take it off my wrist for a quick charge when I get into bed at night as I’m usually still on my iPad or reading a book for at least half an hour. Then I put it back on again when I go to sleep. From 100% at midnight the Series 9 has been around the 30-40% mark come 11pm. That includes around 7 hours as a sleep tracker, general day use and 30 minutes on the treadmill and walking the dog. Note that for the last few generations the Apple Watch now has a permanently on screen, so you don’t need to lift your arm to activate the screen.There is one big improvement for the Apple Watch Series 9 though. Double Tap. This was demonstrated in the Apple launch show in September, and is a means of controlling certain functions on whatever the current live app is by tapping your thumb and index finger on your watch hand together. If a call is coming in, tap your thumb and finger to answer it. If an alarm is going off, tap your thumb and finger together to silence it. This means you’re able to interact with your Watch without your other hand. That might sound a bit daft, but in practice I can imagine that being really useful. I use timers a lot in the kitchen and I’ve often got greasy or floury hands when a timer goes off, so this could well be a useful function I use a lot. I say could, because at the time of writing Apple haven’t activated it. It’s apparently going to be available in a software update in October.There are an awful lot of options for buying an Apple Watch Series 9. It comes in two standard sizes, 41mm and 45mm, and is available in GPS only or GPS + cellular form. There is the Ultra 2 as well, which is only GPS + cellular and is 49mm. You’ve then also got a huge array of colours and straps to choose from. I went with the 45mm GPS only version, which I would imagine will be the most common option. There’s £30 difference in the RRP of the 41mm and 45mm, and the extra screen size is more than worth it. My Series 3 was 42mm, and despite only an extra 3mm increase the Series 9 fits so much more on its screen that the Series 3. It makes such a big difference so I would recommend the larger size. Regarding whether you need cellular, this will be down to what you’ll use it for. My Series 3 was cellular, and for the first few years I paid for a separate contract with EE which started at £5 per month but gradually got more and more expensive. It was nice to be able to leave my phone behind on workouts, but when COVID landed and our lifestyles changed I found that I no longer needed the Watch to be cellular, and cancelled my EE contract. I can genuinely say I haven’t noticed. The occasions when I might not have my phone with me are so rare that it just wasn’t worth the extra cost of buying the Watch and then the ongoing sim contract.Set up of the watch was as straight-forward as Apple products usually are. I’d backed up my Series 3 and when I turned on the 9 it gave me the option to install from my backup. I said yes and everything came over automatically. The only thing I needed to do was add the 3-digit code from my payments cards to Apple Pay. If you’re new to Apple Watch, do remember that it is still dependant on having an iPhone. An iPhone continues to be the life support for Apple Watch.So, is the Apple Watch Series 9 right for you? Given the very minor improvements over the previous two generations, I would say that there’s little reason to upgrade from a Series 7 or 8. However, earlier generations will see a marked improvement over their current watches. I debated for a long time whether to finally go for it, but the difference over my Series 3 is significant. Most things still look the same, but they work more reliably and efficiently. The brightness of the screen is noticeable. I’ve got more information on my home screen than I had previously. The extra size of the screen is barely noticeable on my wrist.For me, I feel justified in my purchase of the Series 9. Even with the 6 year gap, there isn’t a huge difference, but it’s enough for me to be satisfied I’ve made the right decision. I wish Apple could sort out the battery life, and one day a blood pressure monitor will be great, but until then the Series 9 is the new benchmark for smart watches.

    I decided it was time for an upgrade from my very faithful series 4 to the mighty series 9 & like so many reviews that I have read, it certainly is noticeably faster.As with every Apple product, you truly get what you pay for; ease of use, bright display, fast speeds & a fab fitness tool (as well as a stylish looking watch).This watch is a must have if you’re looking to put your health (and now well being) first. The sheer amount of workouts you can now do on here and that it’s able to track is amazing! You can now log your mental health on the watch too which I I think is a lovely new feature alongside it’s multitude of stately features such as; fall & crash detection.I also now love that it’s a carbon neutral product, so no more guilt in how this is been created and how it’s impacting the environment.If I’m honest, if you are thinking about what size to opt for, I would say spend a little more and go for the 45mm as the watch truly shines on a bigger screen. The graphics, watch faces and workout metrics just look stunning and let’s face it. We only live once, so treat yourself!Overall, I’m very happy with this product. Have never been let down by Apple & on this occasion they have really done a fab job upgrading their watches! Enjoy!!

    Whether the cost of updating from Series 7 to 9 was wise I guess is subjective. The 9 is a good watch wind has some features the 7 didn't possess, and it depends entirely upon ones wants & needs. The change over wasn’t seamless unfortunately, but even an 80+ yr old like me could handle it. The few unexpected problems were resolved thanks to Prof Google, & I have the watch set to my liking. I did watch several YouTube videos to see what is new, what to delete, and what to turn on etc & everything is working satisfactorily. May post another of these in a few months Tim, if I’m still here…..

    I love these watches. If you want one then you likely know what it can do. There are more cheaper options but none of them can match what this does when paired with an iphone. Everything just works. Its smooth like butter and there's none of the small niggles you see with other watches.Yes it's a lot of pennies but you can tell that a lot of work has gone into every part of the process.I like my cheaper watches for times when my watch could be at risk but at all other times you will find me wearing this :)

    Lovely watch. No idea how to use it until I have time to go online to view instructions. This is the first Apple Watch I’ve had having traded up from a Fitbit. I used to charge my Fitbit once a week. This watch needs charging every 36 hours. How I am I supposed to do that with the charger supplied? It is a magnetic charger but instead of a USB lead it has a type C lead. Everything I have is Apple and every plug I have is USB. All my computers and gadgets only have USB ports. In the end I paid an additional £15 for a new charger. Apple this is disgraceful!! I paid £400 for the watch!!

    I was about to buy the 8th gen after my watch was returned as I didn’t know there were new watches, and didn’t really care about getting something super new, but while searching up, I came across the series 9 which will cost only £30 more compared to the series 8! So I ordered one.Now after few hours, I can say It is noticeably faster than the series 7 for sure. Text is clear and as a productivity tool, alongside with other Apple devices, it is worth every penny.I wish simple loop options were available though.

    I was hesitant buying an apple product from Amazon, especially one that's renewed. A note that I bought the highest level renewed (I think extremely good condition was the phrasing?). There are no scratches on the device and the battery life was at 90% of when it was originally purchased which I was happy with, I would've returned had it been less than 80%.I've had it for over two weeks and there don't seem to be any software issues, it runs smoothly, tracks my fitness and connects seamlessly to my Spotify and Strava which is what I predominantly use it for. The heart rate and ECG functions also work well. My Apple devices also recognise its legitimacy and adding it to my apple devices wasn't an issue. Great product, really happy! And it came a day early which was a bonus :)

    Bought this as a gift for my partner. He only wore it a handful of times and the screen has already cracked due to no fault of his. Due to the poor quality of the product the screen doesn’t work at all so the watch is useless now unless I want to pay to get it fixed. Wouldn’t recommend ordering from here.

    Great watch
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2023,"







  
  
    At first I was a bit sceptical about this watch as it wasn’t over priced and it had £6.00 discount off at checkout. I have been pleasantly surprised by what a great little gadget it is. Once I’d got it all set up and linked to my phone, it has surpassed my expectations. I realised that I needed to have a slightly different Bluetooth setup to answer calls, it was driving me mad as to why I could receive but not answer or make calls, so once I’d overcome this, I felt much happier with the purchase. It measures my bpm, stress levels, alerts me of phone calls, facility to set an alarm, counts my steps, and can link in with gym activities and more facilities. It will also link in with my Spotify, I can skip songs from my watch that I’m not fussed about. I can make and receive calls. You can change the clock to a number of designs, and also pay for some if you want to, but personally I’m happy with the free choices. I chose the purple strap, as 1) it’s my favourite colour and 2) I thought it would probably wear better against sweat and day to day wear and tear. All in all I’m chuffed with my purchase that I treat myself to out of some birthday money.

    This watch is amazing 10 out of 10. I'm very happy I bought it. It arrived a day earler than the delivery date said (just as well I work from home) boxed lovely and was on 98% charge. I watched a few videos on YouTube before it arrived so I would know how to use it and tips. This is the best smart watch I've bought by far I'm looking forward to trying it out over the next few days. It's amazing all the things it dose for the price I paid in sale. I'm not big into technology so I was delighted setting this up was soooo easy. I have a few Alexa devices in my home so paired this up to it. The sound quality it great for the size I made a call and could hear them perfectly.  I would  highly recommended product

    I like the fact that is doesn't look ridiculously big on my small wrist.  As for accuracy, it's hard to tell but it is consistent, so I may not actually getting my daily 10,000 steps in but that doesn't bother me as it still encourages me to get out there and walk.  I love the phone feature (but then, I am a gadget girl!).  I am not a fitness fanatic so I probably don't use this smartwatch to it's full potential, but I do like it :)  It pairs well with the app on my phone but I do have to regularly 'pair' it so that I get proper updates.

    I have always used Fitbit but since the awful app update my watch kept failing to sync. I was very sceptical about this watch because of the price but I’m so impressed!!! The steps are pretty much inline with what I’ve become use to on the Fitbit! I mainly wanted it for the steps and running and there is plenty of information in the app for health and fitness data. I’m really impressed. The call function is a bonus, calls are clear and it’s as if I was on my mobile. Not one to bother with reviews usually but this watch really is a great little find!!

    Overall, I couldn't be much happier with this purchase.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 June 2023,"







  
  
    I have to say this watch is good, and reasonably price for all the useful features built into it.  While there are a couple of additional features that would have made this an exceptional product at this price point, you have to accept you are not paying anywhere near what the top end smart watches demand, which makes this a very good purchase. One of the things I really like about this watch is that that it is not just a sports watch, although there is the option to select 24 sports modes from a list of more in the app for those who need exercise tracking.It has the standard health tracking such as steps and distance (which can be set in miles or km), heart rate, Blood oxygen, Stress monitoring, sleep monitoring.  Unfortunately, there is no blood pressure measurement, which might have been useful.It also has some other really cool features, firstly you can make and receive calls on the watch using the built in speaker and mic (which works well, judging from the fact the people at the other end didn't know I was calling from the watch).  There is even an option to set up a number of contact in the app (and therefore on the watch so you don't have to remember frequently used numbers.  I have not been able to make/answer calls on the watch while using hands free earbuds/headphones, it seems to default to the watch unless you make/answer calls on the phone, but that could just be I haven't worked it out yet.Alexa built in, this is one of the reasons I bought this watch, and like all Alexa devices it is great when it works.  As we all know, sometimes talking to Alexa devises can be like getting a naughty 5yr old to do what you want, and occasionally that applies here.  You can request information, control smart home devices such as light bulbs, although it tends to take a little longer to complete the request than some devices.  Its really easy to sign into you amazon account and start using Alexa, takes less than a minute.  Which is a good thing because you will need to log back in every few days, even if you check stay logged in.Other useful features include noise monitoring, which is definitely useful if your unfortunate enough to have noisy neighbours for example.  Music Control on yr phone, which removes the need to get the phone out to change tracks or the volume level, etc.  There is also a Find my phone/watch option if you forget where you left one of them. It even has a Flash light built in, which I thought was a bit gimmicky, but find that I do use it. I am not going to mention time/weather other than to say, its a watch and has what you would expect.  There is a choice of multiple dials, several of which can be downloaded onto the watch, what is different is you have a choice of 3 custom dials.One thing that is a little disappointing to me personally is that the Watch will receive notifications from SMS, Calendar and some social media apps, but the options here are limited.  I would have liked to have seen smart home apps included for set up within the app, so that security device notifications will vibrate on your wrist.  This is something I have seen on some very cheap, allegedly (but not particularly) smart watches. Maybe this will be addressed in future app updates.The final point I want to make is that I have seen some negative comments about Tensky Customer Services, I personally has found them to be very helpful, providing very good after sales support.  I can only think of two other companies that offer this kind of customer support.Overall, I couldn't be much happier with this purchase.

It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

     I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. 😀👍

    I purchased one of these tablets for my food business.  Surprised to find that they came with several accessories, namely cover, mouse, screen protector etc.  Thereafter, was pleased enough to purchase a second one three days later.  Both have now been set up for the staff to print off food safety labels daily.  So far so good.  We will see how this works.  For peace of mind, both of the tablets come with 2 year guarantees.  Seller certainly has confidence in their products.

    This tablet is very fast utilising 10 gb of Ram, has great clarity of colour and resolution.  The extra keyboard and mouse are easily attached and work seamlessly with the tablet.There is also a 2 year warranty which you can apply for easily by email and I received mine very quickly.I use it mainly for surfing the Web and playing games.  So far I can find nothing to complain about this tablet altogether an amazing piece of kit for the money I paid.

    It was easy to set up, has mouse, keyboard, case and all the fittings that you need. It is quick on the internet and easy to download apps. The battery isn't great and will probably only give about 6 hours if not connected to a power source but that's a small complaint for something at this price. Nearly didn'y buy it as it seemed to be too good a price.

    This was a very cheap iPad - and I’m a little bit harsh in not giving 5 stars…. It works perfectly, great condition, no marks or scratches.However- it needs to be noted that it can’t be upgraded to run the latest version of iOS, so there were some apps that I couldn’t put on.I was setting up with a new Apple ID - so couldn’t get you tube for example. It may be possible if you have an existing apple account to bring a legacy version down, but I didn’t try this. Just a point to note if you are thinking of getting this model.Having said that, it does almost everything else and is really good for the price I paid.

    After being a regular user of the Apple Pencil gen 2 switching to this pencil felt no different with the only annoyance was it not being as smooth when writing compared to the Apple Original. In addition mot having the double tap to switch between pen and eraser was also a bummer as I hoped to have that feature present, as the product listing didn’t not mention anything of it, I was left expecting the feature to be there however I was disappointed to not have it. Finally not having a pop up informing me of the percentage charge of the pencil when I magnetically attach it was another inconvenience.

    Decent set of earbuds the I13 wireless Ordtop head phones 5.3
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2023,"







  
  
    My new phone meant I needed new earbuds as more phones are coming without a wired connection. I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity of sound on phone calls using these new ‘wireless’ earbuds. I’ve checked how my voice sounds with my callers, and I’m told it’s just as good. The instructions with the Ordtop I13 True wireless earbuds were also easy to follow. And they come with a different size selection of earbud silicone tips, which gave me options to find which fits my ear best.And once Bluetooth (5.3 techs) is connected, an LED light shows how much power is left in the charging case when taking the buds out. It means the earbuds come out of the case fully charged. After a week, I haven’t had to recharge the case! I guess this depends on how many hours one uses the buds. But based on my experience, I’m impressed as it seems to support the claim of a 40-hour playback time.The big test was playing music on my phone as I was used to my old Apple wired earbuds (which had good base notes and high range) on an Android.I wasn’t disappointed with these earbuds (especially considering the price difference!) I find the playback sound of my favourite tracks to be excellent. I used them outside, in the wind and rain, and the noise cancellation was just as effective.I agree that the sound is immersive and rich, with a deep base and good high-tone quality as a default setting. There is no way to alter these settings, if you are seeking this, you need to look at a higher price point, but I am delighted with the integrated settings on the Ordtop I13 true wireless earbuds.All in all, a good buy.

    Hands down the best ear buds I have owned!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2023,"







  
  
    I want to start off by saying that when it comes to headphones/ear buds I am a bit of a snob. You really do get what you pay for when it comes to earbuds. I currently own some JBL by and some Sennheiser ones, with the Sennheiser costing me almost £200. I like to listen to a lot of music and so I like it to sound top quality. One of my earbuds keeps losing connetion with Bluetooth so they are on their way out hence me wanting a new pair!I decided to give these a try based on reviews both on Amazon and other websites.This is my first ever Beats purchase and was apprehensive as I've heard some negative things about Beats headphones either not being worth the money or that a £10 pair work better.Anyway, I absolutely love these!! I bought the pink ones and I look I've how they look. The case is also a much better shape than most as it is narrow and could be carried in your pocket more or less unoticed. They are also great for cancelling out loud noises if you have no music or whatever playing. Although you can still hear, the reduce the noise so much and so I think they would be an excellent choice for someone with sensory issues. As soon as I opened the case, a message popped up on my iPhone just like it does when you first connect an iPad or watch etc. It was just so simple to pair them!Inside the box are instructions, some smaller and larger tips and also a small wire which as a usb-c to -usb-c meaning you can use your usb-c to lightening cable plug which comes with the iPhones 11 and up. Each earbud has a physical button to press to end call, switch music etc. I much prefer this to my other tap to touch earbuds as it doesn't always register the first tap and you also you are far less likely to accidentaly nudge them.Right onto the most important aspect - the sound. I am really impressed by these. They sound quite a lot better than my Sennheiser ones. Sennheiser have always had a reputation for being one of the best on the market and so to think these are better just shows you they are worth the money! I can actually hear bits in songs that I have never heard before at all, such as backing harmonies or certain instruments. Some headphones/earbuds and known to sound better for some genres of music than others. For example, Sennheiser are known to give any rock/metal a really good sound. As a rock and metal fan, I can honestly say that these have made some of my favourite songs sound even better.I think a lot of people buy Beats for the name or trend purposes and if that's the case then at least paying for the name provides some excellent quality earbuds.Lastly, another feature I like is that you can check the battery percentage for each airbud individually - thus meaning you will get twice  the battery life if you listen to anything with just one earbuds in. I think that's a cool little touch. I really do recommend these. (P.s. Thats my honest and genuine opinion, I haven't been asked to leave a good review in exchange for anything - just thought I'd throw that out there!

    I highly recommend these. I got them on sale from amazon warehouse during the last prime days and I can only compare them against other three earbuds I've owned as an iPhone user:1. Sony WF-1000XM3: compared to the Sony's the Beats are waaay better, better noise cancellation, better sound, more comfortable and better integration with iPhone. Transparency mode is way better on the Beats.2. Jabra Elite 75t​, there's no comparison. The Jabra where the first earbuds I owned and I returned them after a week. Noise cancellation is weak, they are more comfortable than the Sony's but sound quality sucks.3. Apple Airpods Pro: these are the best earbuds I used. Noise cancellation is a notch better than the beats, transparency mode is the best across the board, better than the beats. Sounds quality is a notch better than the beats but not my much. These are THE MOST comfortable earbuds out there, you barely notice them on your ears. These have the best integration with any apple product.Today, I'm a happy user of the Beats... you might wonder why? Well, they cost me 1/4 of the Airpods Pro and I get 80-90% of the value. I can't really afford paying £250 for earbuds but I can afford paying £60. These are really good.

    Noise cancelation and Transparency

    The Noise cancellation is not very good because I still can hear each step I take I can hear it in my beats which makes it so annoying for me that I cannot use the noise cancellation including the transparency. The transparency doesn't even work in the AirPods Pros have the best transparency because the outer airport has a length which has a microphone, which is very good plus transparency is meant to be everywhere whilst it feels like I'm in an aeroplane.

    I managed to get a pair of these from Amazon Warehouse which gave me a little saving.The case looks good and the earbuds are lightweight. The battery life is great although I usually only use them for about an hour at a time.Marked down because I don’t find them comfortable even with the smallest ear pieces in place. They protrude out of my ears more than I expected and do get caught on my hair. I also find the controls too sensitive and often pause or skip songs when trying to readjust them. One last negative is that you can’t control volume through them. However, the sound quality is great and the active noise cancellation works well.

    Pretty good for the price but some compromises
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2022,"







  
  
    I have been using the Beats Studio Buds for over a month now, and I can say that it’s a pretty solid experience but there are some very frustrating issues that impact the experience.They are considered  to be a cheaper alternative to AirPods and they are a good bang for your buck, generally speaking.Going for these rather than the AirPods does saves you about £140 for very solid quality however, you should be aware of the what you will compromise for that nice price tag.Let’s start with the good things:1. Sound quality. It’s very good for £110. For most users, I’d say it’s more than enough. Perhaps audiophiles will not be satisfied but nonetheless, this is not one of its major issues.2. Noise cancellation. It’s not bad at all. Not as good as the AirPods’ but you will not hear anything with it turned on as long as music is playing as well, so solid.This is where these earbuds suffer:3. Design. The earbuds will probably struggle to stay in your ear. You might be able to get them in good, but if you are a bit sweaty or you have some earwax, they will start to slip and you’ll have to push them in.Additionally, this creates another major issue. The play/pause button placement on the two earbuds are a very bad design. Every time the earbud slips out, you’ll have to push it back in, and you’re most likely going to press the button and pause the music. You might be able to avoid this by pinching the earbuds and pushing them in that way, but you still might press it down because the button overlaps the edges.This has become incredibly frustrating as time has gone on, and it has made me consider getting new headphones just because of this.4. Battery life. It’s actually pretty good. I don’t think it’s close to what is advertised but it has been a major issue for me personally. However, the issue with the battery is that, in order to connect your earbuds, it is reliant on the case having some charge. If your case is dead but the earbuds are not, you cannot connect them through Bluetooth.It is honestly ridiculous that you can’t use the earbuds in that case because you might have another few hours of charge from the earbuds themselves but you cant use them! It’s crazy because my first generation AirPods connected fine when the case was dead, as long as the AirPods themselves had charge. I don’t understand why it needs the case to connect, cant the earbuds themselves have Bluetooth chips? I guess they don’t, so it’s a bad design. It’s not something that would deter me personally from the using the device entirely as it takes a few days before the case runs out of charge, but if you don’t notice the case reaching 0% you will no longer be able to listen to your music.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds are not a bad purchase. If you aren’t looking to spend £250 on AirPods Pros right now, this is a very good option for a cheaper alternative, but I would not recommend this as anything other than temporary or as secondary headphones as there are some pretty major drawbacks that unfortunately ruin what is otherwise a really good experience when it comes to actually listening to the music.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2023,"







  
  
    After initially thinking I’d made the wrong choice of earbuds I’m actually very surprised by them. The one thing I would advise anyone buying these is that the ear tip fitting is a LOT more crucial with them than any previous earbuds I’ve owned and the “medium” ear tips pre fitted are actually closer to a “small” ear tip on other brands. Get this right and you’ll have a very good pair of earbuds, noise cancellation could be better but it’s on par with others in this price range

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

    great product but... Right Headphone not charging
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2023,"







  
  
    I brought these earbuds in march this year, to go running with out cables sticking to you.They have been amazing to use, quality is good. they feel comfy in your ears and easy to use.all in all great pair of earbuds. but for some reason the right earbud has decided to not hold its charge as when I go for a run the music is interrupted and says ""battery low"" a few times then powers down. but now it wont charge at all. it is quite annoying as they are housed together all the time but the left earbud seems to be perfectly fine.

    Great sound quality, comfortable, long battery life
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2023,"







  
  
    I love the sound quality of these, which are excellent.  They are also comfortable to wear for long periods and don't fall out easily at all.  The battery life is particularly impressive and I'm amazed at how long they last on a single charge!  The only downsides are the touch controls (which I find annoying rather than helpful - but you do learn to not touch the bottom parts of them after a while), the voice that says ""pairing"", ""connected"" and ""disconnected"" is a bit too loud (just remember not to have them in your ears while pairing or connecting/disconnecting them!).  And in my experience, the audio lag is noticeable when watching any form of TV or video.  To be fair I haven't tried it on a very recent device, but on Samsung TV (AU7100 with Bluetooth 4.2), PC with Bluetooth dongle (v5.3), and my work laptop (a few years old now - can't tell which Bluetooth version it supports) there's always a bit of a lag.  Whether this is the earphones or the source devices I can't say for sure, but it does mean I don't use these for watching TV or video and save them for listening to music around the house, for which they are truly excellent!

    Touch button takes a while to get used to.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 September 2023,"







  
  
    The product looks neat. It connects as soon as you open the case. However I found a couple of things frustrating. One is the case, it feels like a smooth little pebble in my hands and my hands are dry, I had to use my nails to pry open the case and to get the ear pieces out. I keep worrying that it would slip out of my hands, then drop and break. The other thing is the touch button. Everytime I use to turn the ear buds on or off, it turns the volume up, after a few times it literally shouts in my ears. This happens with both ear pieces. I mainly use them to listen to audio books. I had to turn the volume down with my phone volume buttons.

    It's great having something so easy to charge and to store safely. The sound quality is crisp and clear but I find to the ear buds a bit uncomfortable after a while, perhaps it's just my ears but a softer shell may be better.

    Some issues and lacking in some areas. (Review of a Music Technician)
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2023,"







  
  
    Before starting this review I’d just like to say that experiences might differ from person to person. This is from your own testing and interpretation over the past week.Being a Music Technician I spend a lot of time with headphones, earphones, speakers and almost any type of audio equipment you can think of. Over time I’ve developed a good ear for quality or inconsistencies that other might not hear themselves.Using this particular pair of earphones I can tell you in all honesty I didn’t get them because I thought they’d be good, I got them as more of quick use wireless earphones for things like the gym. They have been great for things like that, they have maintained they’re connection through every use and also sound pretty good at medium volume. Issues start to arise when you really listen to them or increase you volume.Something I’ve noticed with this particular pair I’ve received is that at loud volumes there is this sound that can only be described as “the bass being underwater”. It only seems to happen when the volume is at full or close to full but it is extremely noticeable and I find myself not putting them at max volume a lot of the time. (You shouldn’t do that anyway, but it’s worth mentioning).Something else I’ve noticed is that these earphones are apparently supposed to have some kind of “noise cancellation” which I have barely noticed any such kind of feature. If there is noise cancellation it is very faint and I’m still unsure if it even has noise cancellation.Something else I’d like to comment on is how these compare to other wireless earphones of a similar price. There is a lot of different brands out there to use. Most people choose Apples AirPods and rightly so, they are a quality pair of wireless earphones that only really brought down by their price. These wireless earphones I feel are incorrectly priced, I get them discounted from their normal price yet I still felt that even if I had bought them at their normal price they wouldn’t be worth it. For example Google’s earbuds with are roughly £20 more are leagues better than these and will definitely stand the test of time. Yet after a week with these I have noticed multiple issues. Sound at low and mid ranges are actually pretty good, but again the bass can feel weak and has issues when turned up to full volume.Some good points I’d like to note on, cause are there are some, is the battery life and feel of the product. The battery took multiple days before they ran out of charge on the case, the EarPods in of themselves can run out within roughly 4-5 hours of constant use which is expected. Thanks to the battery life of the case however, this is more than made up for. I’ve found the battery life of the case will last close to a week keeping the EarPods charged.The quality of feel and aesthetic is something worth noting on, although they might not be a sleek at AirPods they are good for what they are. Everything has a good weight and look and feels somewhere in between quality and cheap feeling. The actual lid of the case is probably the cheapest feeling part of the whole product and just feels lighter than everything else, the snap from closing the case feels more cheap because of it. Unfortunately.Overall, I’ll say these earphones did their job. They’ve been useful for the gym, commuting and regular usage. They lack in many areas however and I’d only recommend them if they were discounted because I don’t feel like they are worth their actual price. Keeping in mind it is possible I have received a faulty pair in terms of the under water sounding bass, the sound is decent and honestly does the job. If you are wondering what to do I’d say have more of a look around at other earbuds before trying these, and if you are trying these really spend some time with them to see if your problems are similar to mine and from there request a replacement or refund.

    Broke after 8 months but were good whilst they lasted
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    Bought these back in Feb and they’ve now broken - one has come apart and stopped working.They were decent whilst they lasted. I’m not a sound buff so can’t comment on the quality of sound etc but for me they were fine. I used them most days so got quite a lot of use out of them but were hoping they would last much longer than they did.I think these are fine if you want a cheap option and aren’t too worried about their longevity. I am going to buy a more expensive pair this time and hopefully they will last longer, but things seem to be designed to break these days.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

    I was expecting a more metallic purple like the images but it was more matt that i thought, but i will see what the sound quality is like once they are fully charged & will see how long the battery lasts.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

    Had this pair of earphones for a couple of weeks now, loving them!The appearance is the feature I love the most, metallic feel across all the parts you touch.The weight is also very good too.The sound quality is excellent, very suitable for listening music and also for video conferencing too.The earbud shape is very ergonomically design to sit comfortably in the ear and does not feel painful after hours of use.Overall an excellent product and highly recommend to others.

    Pleasantly surprised
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 November 2022,"







  
  
    I was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality and the quality of the mic.Pros:- Audio quality is superb- Mic sensor is surprisingly good! I feel it picks up sound even better than my dedicated USB condenser mic!- Pairing with different devices was very easy - I tried pairing and unpairing with various devices, and the process was very easy (I had a pair of Anker wireless earphones and I am scared to unpair them because it was too fiddly to re-pair!)Cons:- Maybe the material of the casing isn't to my liking. I would personally have preferred plastic than aluminium. However, having said that, the case is very lightweight- The supplied USB cable is not the most premium I have seen. But it does the job.Overall, compared to the Apple Airpods, its a bargain!

    Great uninterrupted bluetooth connectivity
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2022,"







  
  
    I have been using these headphones for a few weeks. The Bluetooth connectivity is very stable. It's so easy to re-connect, and switch between single-ear-mode and twin-ear-mode. You take one out of the case, and that one connects in single-ear-mode. You take the second one out and it immediately switches to twin-ear-mode.The battery lasts for ages. I think I only recharged the case once in weeks.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2023,"







  
  
    I’ve had similar ones before and loved them. However, these make an annoying noise everytime I do an action and they leak sound so even on half volume, people around me can hear what I’m listening to- kinda defeats the purpose… Quality isn’t the best either

    God knows I’ve tried to pause them via taps etc, all this seems to do is switch them off, it’s then a nightmare to switch them back on again.BUT if you happen to I don’t know tuck your hair behind your ear, or turn you head quicker than usual. That will not only pause them, but it will also fast forward or again switch them off….

    Dreadful headphones
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2023,"







  
  
    They are cheap and it shows, they let all outside noise in, don’t stay in my go ear and I have to have my volume up full to hear the music. They also keep trying to turn themselves off. Complete waste of money. If I’d not used them a few times I’d send them back.

     These are decent bluetooth ear buds. The sound is good, not amazing but for the price, they are definitely worth it.I find them comfortable to wear, and the battery life lasts just under 5 hours of constant use.Super easy to charge with a USB C cable, and you can use just one whilst the other is in the charging pod.The red pair came with 2 sets of ear buds, much better than only have one size to choose from,.The charging pod lights up when it's plugged in charging - but there isn't an indication of when the charging pod is out of battery.The earbuds themselves warn you when there is 10% left and they need charging so that's a plus.£19.99 at time of review.

     I’ve used many headphones in my time and these are definitely worth the money if ur not using them 24/7 non stop.  Using them for 4-5 hours  you will start to notice u occasionally have to re adjust them in ur ears as the comfort level isn’t the best.  Although it’s lacking features such as base boost and vocal boost you still have a good quality sound and if you have on 70-100% volume level  you won’t be hearing anything else around you they are easy to set up and use  and once u disconnect it will automatically reconnect to ur device once open the slick black appearance is nice tho scratches will show. The battery life for me was about 12 hours at 70% volume.
