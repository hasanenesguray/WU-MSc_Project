    Great quality but expensive
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023,"







  
  
    The phone looks exactly as it it has just come out of the factory, perfect in every way. With hindsight though almost £100 for a six year old phone seems a bit much, in particular as it will not be able to use the newer IOS.

    The sweet spot in the current lineup
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2023,"







  
  
    Finally rid of the notch and lightning connection. The reason I purchased this.Nicely boxed with tamper sealingComplete with a Braided usb-c lead accessory which is cool.Has the usual sim pin included in the UK.I wish the telecoms market would get their act together on eSIM.Colour, I had intended to get boring black but I chose a pastel Matt Green with the glossy apple logo to the rear. Chosen more due to the fact that the other colours had sold out but I actually like it now I’ve got it and its colour is concealed in my OtterBox Strada case anyway.On opening, the first thing you will notice is how lightweight the phone is and in my position only weighed down by the case weight.You will notice the dual cameras are very pronounced and the phone doesn’t lay flat on a surface.My case offers excellent protection for the lenses and allows it to lay flush.The iPhone has an aluminium casing with lovely rounded edges.Set up for my experience. This was the painful part.Transferring data from my iPhone 11 was not the easiest of tasks and I had to take an update to the fifteen before it would initiate the transfer process.However Once completed my new phone was near identical in appearance and usability apart from one or two apps that required setting up again.The Home Screen is large, bright and colourful is blessed with something called the Dynamic island which alters its size and shape dependent on the app that requires it.This is a great feature introduced to recent Apple phones and transforms the viewing experience when watching content playback of the likes  of Prime, Netflix, Disney etc.It is finally a really enjoyable viewing experience now the dreaded notch has gone.Some have mentioned a lower refresh rate on this model compared to the Pro models but is not a noticeable problem for me.Not just watching but the Sound quality even at low volumes is brilliant particularly when watching movies.Watch Blade Runner 2049 or rather listen to it on the Apple app is a totally immersive experience even without AirPods.Officer K’s visit to the Wallace Corporation’s Earth Headquarters has great depth and echo as he exchanges dialogue with the file clerk and Luv in its large halls.iOS 17 standby mode is slightly disappointing down to the exclusivity of the pro models only having an always on display. But this is the only real disappointment of this model.The ability to plug in USB devices and exchange data or charge or receive power from other devices is a real step forward.Battery life is phenomenal. End of!Doesn’t get hot when charging and lasts ages. Unless you have got it glued to your face you can expect a couple of days between charges for average use and when the battery is new of course.I have some older wireless chargers that are struggling a bit to charge through the mag safe case with the phone attached.This hasn’t been an issue before with my other phones. I haven’t got a new type mag safe charger yet and is not really a phone issueThe camera has several new features including automatically picking out portraits without specifically switching to portrait mode.It has a up to 48 mega pixel camera and with iOS 17 can produce bokeh effect portraits.There are some brilliant video modes including a live action sports type mode.4K or HD recording and frame rate adjustment.

    It comes with no charger, but with charging cable.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023,"







  
  
    Received the iPhone 15 plus for a friend of mine only to find that apple have been stingy and not provided a charging plug but they supply the cable. It’s ironic that if you buy an iPad from apple you will get a charging plug but not for the iPhone which costs twice as much as an iPad. Obviously I have had to order a charging plug separately but legally apple are selling something that technically is not fit for purpose because if you don’t have any means of charging the iPhone then it’s practically no good to you. Secondly there was no mention of what is supplied with the iPhone so it could be classed as mis-selling. Is this apple trying to be revengeful against the EU who forced them to have a usb-c socket instead of an eight pin blade on their iPads and iPhones. I expect so!

",Reviewed in Germany on 27 September 2023,"







  
    Wie jedes Jahr wollte ich mir nicht das neue iPhone kaufen und habs mir – wie jedes Jahr – doch gekauft.🤣🥳Dieses Mal wurde es die gelbe Plus Version. Ich hatte vorher das 14 plus.Allein von der Kamera her lohnt sich der Umstieg. Das 15+ macht Fotos wie früher nur die Pro Modelle. für mich als Wenigfotografierer lohnt sich ein Pro nicht.Das Plus hat gegenüber den normalen 15ern aber auch schon mehr Akkulaufzeit.Was für mich weiterhin Sinn macht, ist der USB C Anschluss, da ich im Besitz eines iPad Pro bin und auch im Besitz eines MacBook, so dass ich jetzt alles mit dem gleichen Kabel laden kann.Die Rückseite ist etwas matter und der Apfel nicht mehr silber auf der Rückseite. Das ist das einzige, was mir nicht so gut gefällt optisch. Aber das ist jammernnauf hohem Niveau.Von mir natürlich klare Kaufempfehlung 🤣🥳Kleiner Wermutstropfen an dem ganzen System. Update ist, dass bei der Apple Watch die Batterieanzeige und das anpingen vom unteren Bildschirmrand nicht mehr geht. Aber das hat mit dem Handy an sich nichts zu tun.

    I purchased this phone for my Mum, and spent ages reading the reviews, which were both good and bad.  I received it this morning and couldn't be happier with it.  There is a tiny scratch on the screen and a couple of very fine airline scratches on back, but that is it.  I was not impressed with the cable that came with it, when I removed it from my plug the cover of the usb came off in my hands, so threw that straight in the bin and I ordered a set of 2 x fast charging plugs with the cables.  I bought a lovely clear case with rose gold edging to finish it off.  I have never purchased refurbished tech before but would definitely recommend, in my case I have been able to upgrade my Mum's phone for a lot less.

    Great value for money, works perfectly, looks brand new no scratches on screen or case. One tiny downside, battery is at 87%. But seeing as the iPhone 12 has been out for a few years, it’s understandable. Didn’t come in original box but the listing clearly states that it may not. All in all? Good for a few years, still getting updates and at a fraction of the cost of a new one. Why pay more if you don’t have to?

As app are basically the same .Only best features is that it has 5G and battery life is a small bit longer  the camera .Also since they got rid of earphones and plug. They could have included a cover to protect the cameraSo you get less for money than before

    My wife and I have had IPhones for years but as normal with Apple prices are getting out of hand! We moved away from contracts 5 years ago so buy them outright.We had 11 so the move to 14 was a big jump. The better half is pleased and says it does what’s she wants.Gone are the days when we want the latest model. If you change just before the new model is released often it’s on a discount and was on 5 months interest free! Not much difference with Apple year to year as they want you to change as often as possible.We won’t change now till 18 so another 3 years sorted.

    Brilliant refurbished phone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 October 2023,"







  
  
    Just over £200 for a refurbished iPhone 12 mini. Absolute bargain. The condition of it is like brand-new there’s not a mark anywhere on it as you can see in the pictures. I’ve had an iPhone 15 which got sent back because this one does everything that that one does for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 has a slightly better camera and better speakers for listening to music but to me it wasn’t worth an extra £500 on top of the price of this. I was worried about the size, but the size is perfect. It’s such a good quality screen that you forget how small this phone is and I’m surprised by how quick I can type on the keyboard is very clever. I’m very intuitive and very responsive. And the appearance is so cool, I love the blue as well which is an added bonus on top of everything else and the price. I think I found a new way to find future phones. Definitely recommended.

    Great phone, appalling battery life
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2023,"







  
  
    I love the size of this phone and coming from an iPhone SE, this feels a world away from my previous in terms of features and functionality. The screen also feels much bigger because of the small bezel. Cameras are great, face ID is very quick - I hardly notice it, as by the time I've picked up my phone it will have unlocked already. The battery is truly terrible unfortunately and you can see it draining away under your eyes even with light use. I have ended up having to charge it constantly as it will never make it to the end of the day. Although the battery is at 100% life, I suspect this might be a third-party battery that isn't as good as the original. Either that, or the battery really just is utter cr*p. The screen, camera lens and the back of the phone look absolutely spotless, however there are a few quite obvious chips around the lens cutout and around the charging slot, a bit cheeky to sell as 'excellent quality'. There was also quite a bit of grime/dirt around the screen, which seems weird for a refurbished phone. They could have easily cleaned it a bit better. Other than that this was great value for money.

    NOT WORTH It -  my experience
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2023,"







  
  
    I bought a used IPhone 12 mini in EXCELLENT condition, hoping that the phone will be damage free and with good battery health .I spent 379 for the phone .The phone was nicely packed , the phone had visible marks , the battery health was around 83% which is not good for such an expensive phone , if the batteries health is just above 80% , one would require a new battery in the next 12.months ( so a battery expenditure after 12 months ) which is not worth it . The most important component in an iPhone is the battery which requires replacing earlier than other components.As soon as I put the phone for charging, the phone got hot in 20 minutes which is a sign of a phone requiring repairs in the next few months . I requested for a refund within 45 minutes of receiving the phone .In refurbished phones , the water protection is also compromised. The life of speakers and mic is also reduced which is another potential cost in the future. I am a user of iPhones and had to replace speaker and mic after 5 years .In my opinion it is lnot worth buying a refurbished phone unless you are ready to take a risk , and at what cost . If you are going for a cheap phone then one can take a risk , however not for an expensive iPhone . I finally decided to buy a new phone with peace of mind for the next few years.I returned the phone , I got my money after 2 weeks ( as per the process )I even requested the seller to replace my phone with an excellent condition phone , however they had none in stock .

    I bought this on EMI payments as my old iPhone 5S recently packed up whilst I was involved in the purchase of a house. I needed to spread the cost but also have the full facility of a phone without having to negotiate credit cards, which I didn't want to get into, or pay massive upfront costs. For sixty quid a month (plus my tiny GiffGaff sim) I have a new phone, which will be all paid in a year. I also got 2T of iCould storage and an external generic hard drive for my old Mac around the same time for about 25 quid. This meant I could 'start again' with my Mac, and the endless photos from my travels could be stored safely while I save up for a new Macbook. Meanwhile, this phone has double the storage of my old Macbook. Unlike my old phone, it can perform admin tasks when I'm in quiet moments at work, such as applying for jobs. I'm not meaning to explain phones, it's just that for me new tech isn't renewed that often and I had to justify the expense to myself. This phone has already proved itself over the last month. The camera is much better than my old phone, but not quite as flashy as the most recent iPhone. I couldn't justify an extra 300 quid for a camera, regardless of my professional art needs, that wouldn't really meet my landscape photography needs. You still can't fit a mirror inside an iPhone in order to make it perform as well as an SLR. it's jus tnot physically possible yet to lose that terrible over-size foreground emphasis you get inmost smartphone pics. But for reference photos, portrait photography with friends, and general snaps this camera is good. I have an SLR I will use for landscapes instead, and may upgrade. The joy of a new phone is being able to listen to all the music you couldn't store on the old one, being able to perform complex functions a less powerful phone can't deal with, and also being able to indulge all your interests/needs in one place without worrying about space. I prioritised my phone upgrade before my Macbook upgrade for precisely this reason. If you have to choose between which one to upgrade, I'd go with the phone as you can always get cables to link your phone to a projector or tv screen if you're a student or trying to cut costs in the current economy. I'm amazed at how much I can watch on my unlimited data plan - the only risk is becoming a bit of an internet-addict too quickly. I love a new app called Metronaut too, so useful for musicians, and it's a relief to be able to indule my passions wihtout fear of freeze or collapse. Whenever I have had problems with this, it just requires a switch-off/switch-on - it's usually as I've had too much activity on my phone (for like, hours) or I just haven't closed pages. I""m impressed with the low-light picture-taking too - I can instantly update photos to Insta even in difficult light conditions. It means a better-documented moment-to-moment sense of of the World, and memories get stored, isntead of lost in storage collapse and frustration.

    A step ahead of the game.

    Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

    The phone works well and looks fabulous.It was superbly packaged and arrived on time without a blemish on the phone or the box.  However, I couldn't transfer all my old phone's data over to it until I had performed a ""factory reset"" on the new phone, leading me to believe that it was maybe not completely brand new!I may be wrong, as I say it was without blemish when it landed, but I would have thought that a completely new and unused phone shouldn't require a reset before use! Otherwise, very happy.

    Fingers crossed so far so good. After smashing my new phone at beginning of contract and having no insurance (stupid I know) I needed another I phone quick and not too expensive. Having researched I decided to go with a refurb from Amazon as I liked it is guaranteed for 12 months. The condition was excellent and looked brand new, it was all ready to just put my SIM card in and so far has worked great. I’m really happy and wouldn’t have an issue buying a refurb again.

    Phone is from Apple, and is great. Because it's apple .But..Used one here comes with a knockoff charger, that should go in the garbage straight away - if you value your life. It also came with USB-A to USB-C cable, which with this phone is useless. So if you don't have any iPhones - good luck and order a cable separately. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    My phone has clearly been used by someone not English and hasn’t been completely ‘cleaned’ On WhatsApp the key for emojiwas a world icon and simply changed from 2 languages one English and one I didn’t recognise. There was no instructions how to rectify this and I had to use trial and error before I worked out how to rid it of the second language and restore the emoji symbol.  On my calendar there is an entrant in German. I don’t know how many more examples of the lack of cleaning the phone I am going to find and am worried about this phone now - I have bank details etc and wonder if this phone is even safe

    Maine Coon Kitten destroyed iPhone X
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2023,"







  
  
    Kitten or the “culprit” now set as new screen saver on this iPhone SE 2020 64GB, destroyed my iPhone X to a near unworkable condition. I couldn’t afford to go out and spend £750 - £1,000 + on a new phone, so took a bit of a chance and went for refurbished SE.This cost a much more affordable £119.Condition was graded as “C” on box, but to me it looks like a new phone! No dents, no scratches and clean as a whistle.Delivery was special delivery 24hrs, so received phone almost instantly! Really top points for delivery! Exceptional.Battery is at 96% health as seen in pics.My only real issue that has caused me a headache is the 64GB storage, not enough to take on the iPhone X, and because my phone was so badly damaged I couldn’t remove things to get that memory down.However, I did it a different way, time consuming but has worked out pretty okay. My iPad is pretty much a clone of my phone, so did a full iCloud backup of iPad, had to increase iCloud storage so that’s now £2.99 a month. But I was already paying for 50GB, so in reality it’s an extra cost of £2 a month.Then I asked the iPhone SE to restore from iCloud, because all the photos are compressed this is now taking up 40GB on the iPhone SE. if you need a picture in full HD resolution you just click the cloud button and it will retrieve it for you.Also offloaded apps unlikely to be used on phone, makes them a couple of MB but all the data is saved in the cloud, so at any point you can pull it back. So this has been a solution.It ported in the apps, the passwords, I configured email so that’s all there, messenger was just a log in and its put all that on there. Whatsapp was a case of logging in and thats all gone on, the only thing it hasn’t gone on is contacts. Going to try and find a way to do this later on. If I have to do manually it will be a bit of an ache as about 400+ names and numbers to add!It did want an update to OS 16.6, not a problem, 30 min job.Not put sim in just yet, getting the whole thing fully set up first on Wi-Fi, sim will be last to go in at the end of today.Of course, you can spend more money and get 256GB phone and it will just clone itself. But that’s going to be £££ more.This way I should be up and running by end of the day for £119 - express delivery and to my eye a phone that looks new, with excellent condition battery. Plus I’ve ordered an extra tough case for it, so the “culprit” can’t do a repeat performance, so even if there were some fine scratches / signs of wear, they would be covered by casing anyway.So far so good, will be relived when sim is in, that’s the final step to make and receive calls.Highly recommend, just be mindful that 64GB is quite low storage these days, but as explained above, there is a way around that.A cost effective solution to a desperate situation that needed an emergency replacement. I’m also lead to believe “Wikipedia” that the A13 chip in the SE 2020 is an improvement on the X.Also, this is the fastest item I’ve ever had delivered bar a takeaway, and I live in the Channel Islands. Well impressed with delivery! Impressed with condition of phone “like new” and impressed at that great battery health.I was so distressed after the kitten pulled apart my iPhone X, and worried about replacement costs. I’m so relieved this option existed and hasn’t broke the bank.Think I’m converted to going down the refurbished route in the future, the savings are huge!Many thanks to the seller! 5******

    Ottimo prodotto!!! 😊📱
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 6 July 2023,"







  
    L'iPhone SE 2020 credo che ad oggi sia ancora un gran bel dispositivo , dall'ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo (prodotto ricondizionato arrivato in eccellenti condizioni), che permette di accedere al ""costoso"" mondo Apple senza svenarsi. Ha l'iconico form factor che è stato introdotto con l'iphone 6 (con qualche  miglioria davvero degna di nota in termini di materiali); pertanto, lo smartphone è molto compatto, facilmente utilizzabile con una mano, potente e alla portata di tutti. È quindi perfetto per chi è alla ricerca di uno smartphone che sia allo stesso tempo di alta qualità e pratico. Ha un display Retina HD da 4,7 pollici ed il pratico lettore di impronte digitale. Ottima fotocamera da 12 megapixel che beneficia anche dell'elaborazione delle foto del potente chip A13 (in pratica foto migliori rispetto alle precedenti generazioni); buona fotocamera frontale da 7 megapixel. Come detto, il chip integrato nel telefono è il potente A13 Bionic  che consente di giocare senza problemi ai giochi più recenti, navigare in Internet o guardare film e serie TV in modo fluido e piacevole (equipaggiato con tre giga di ram).  Inoltre, grazie al Neural Engine, l'iPhone SE 2020 è in grado di eseguire compiti che richiedono l'uso dell'intelligenza artificiale, come la classificazione automatica delle foto sul telefono in base al soggetto; presenti, ovviamente, tutti i sensori ""moderni"" (barometro, accellerometro, giroscopio, nfc, ecc). Per quanto riguarda la batteria, con un utilizzo medio, la giornata si fa senza particolari problemi (presente, inoltre, la ricarica wireless). La connettività è la LTE (non presente il jack da 3,5 per le cuffie). Insomma, a mio avviso l'unica cosa da valutare è se rispetto alle proprie esigenze può andar bene il form factor ""old style"" (secondo me sempre bello)  e lo schermo da 4,7 pollici; se tali aspetti non costituiscono un problema, l'acquisto è sicuramente consigliato sia come telefono principale o, in alternativa, come secondo telefono. Valutando poi che, ad oggi, un ricondizionato in condizioni pari al nuovo può essere acquistato ad un prezzo concorrenziale, direi cinque stelle. Spero di essere stato utile 👋🏼

L'outil de retrait de la carte SIM, le chargeur et le câble de chargement étais bien inclus, dommage que les écouteurs n'étaient pas livrés avec.Les qualités :- La qualité photo pour le prix est parfait.- L'écran- La Taille- La Performence- La DurabilitéLes défauts :- La Batterie- La Mémoire- Le StockageJ'ai été très surpris en voyant que le produit répondait à mes attentes même plus.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2023,"







  
  
    I had an issue with the battery not holding its charge or even able to tell me what percentage it had left accurately. Also the screen didn’t feel as responsive as I know an apple phone usually is which could be linked to the battery, I am not sure. I did have to pay for returning however it seems they have reimbursed me for that which I am very happy about and I really do appreciate it which is why I’m giving them a better rating.

    Great phone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2022,"







  
  
    The phone arrived the next day and upon first inspection the condition of the phone was great and looked brand new. There is very slight wear and tear on the corners but they’re not noticeable. My phone did not come in an original IPhone box which did not bother me but may disappoint others, especially if they’re giving it as a gift. The charger I received was not an original apple one and it certainly is not as powerful.I’m a little disappointed in the battery health which is 86% but I guess it’s a risk you take when buying one of these. The screen has also been replaced upon further inspection but it feels every bit as good as an original IPhone one.Overall, for the price I’m happy with my phone and as long as the phone lasts for a year or two, I’ll happily purchase from here again.

    Great Value not so Great Battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020,"







  
  
    I got the product and it was in perfect condition. No scratches or anything on the body which did really surprise me. The only problem was that the battery health was at 83% but for what is basically a half price phone, even in October 2020, this isn’t too much of an issue. It’s still worth it even if I have to replace the battery. Would recommend if you want a top phone on a smaller budget.  Face Recognition is insanely fast i was very surprised as i’m used to the touch ID on older apple phones. However for anyone using this for apple pay, it doesn’t work with a mask on so you’ll have to type your passcode.  OLED screen is fantastic and I would say it’s the best feature of the phone. However for those who aren’t too bothered by this you may not really notice too much difference from the LCD screens on the lower market iPhones.  Doesn’t come in Original packaging and doesn’t come with the earphones for anyone wondering. It did include a charging brick and charging cable.  I personally love the 3D touch on this phone that they removed on the iPhone 11 range if that’s something that you enjoy.  I was slightly worried when i ordered it but that it would come and not be in a good condition. However after using this for a few days i can confirm that this is an all round good buy and would recommend. Would have given 5 stars if the batter health was above 95%.

    bought it six months ago and immediately the battery wasn't healthy and began to deteriorate very quickly and in the end would just switch off. arranged to send it back to the seller and when he received it he said that due to the phone being damaged by me, he would not fix it - I had not damaged the phone and the phone was fine when I sent it.The seller was very unhelpful to the point I had to ask Amazon to step in and help me with the matter which they did.Be cautious here when buying as you may not get the phone you thought it would be and also guarantee is quickly cancelled when you need to use it.

    Great phone with very few marks on the screen, nothing major to affect use. However, when turning the phone on, Apple detects the battery has been changed and a non genuine battery has been used, therefore not displaying the battery health. I’ve been through the listing to double check, and nowhere does it mention the battery being changed. It does however guarantee a battery life of more than 80%, something I’m unable to check now.

    Das neue iPhone 15 Pro hat ein iPhone 11 Pro abgelöst, welches seinen Dienst jahrelang ohne Probleme verrichtet hat. Im Vergleich zum 11 Pro gibt es jetzt tolle neue Features bei der Kamera, die Dynamic Island, den praktischen Action Button, das Always-On Display und vieles mehr - aber das Feature das mich überzeugt und zum Kauf bewegt hat ist ProMotion. Mit den 120 Hz sind Animationen nun so was von flüssig und smooth, dass das 11 Pro im Vergleich dazu Augenschmerzen verursacht. Auf ein Display mit 60 Hz werde ich wohl nicht mehr zurückgehen können. Die 120 Hz passen nun auf jeden Fall perfekt zu meinem MacBook Pro 14"" und dem iPad Pro 11"".Einige Kritikpunkte habe ich allerdings trotzdem:- das Kameramodul ist mit jeder Generation größer geworden und hat mittlerweile ein für mich sehr grenzwertiges Ausmaß erreicht. Ist sicher Geschmacksache, aber mir gefällt dieses riesen Ding auf der Rückseite gar nicht - aber vielleicht gewöhnt man sich mit der Zeit daran.- der Preis ist im Vergleich zum Vorjahr zwar gesunken, ist aber immer noch verdammt hoch für ein Smartphone. Wenn man allerdings berücksichtigt, dass das Smartphone wohl das Gerät ist, welches man am meisten überhaupt verwendet (ist zumindest bei mir so) und eigentlich immer dabei hat, relativiert sich der hohe Preis wieder.Ich finde, das iPhone 15 Pro ist auf jeden Fall ein gelungenes Smartphone und als Upgrade von einem 11 Pro oder vielleicht sogar 12 Pro auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert. Hätte ich bereits ein 13 Pro gehabt, wäre ich bestimmt nicht umgestiegen, da Pro Motion für mich das wichtigste Feature ist und man das ja beim 13 Pro bereits hat. Klare Kaufempfehlung!

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2023,"







  
  
    Certain things just seem like they don't have to be missing, LOG recording, RAW photos, how difficult would it have been to add the action button? - Plus 60hz display still does make the phone feel needlessly sluggish, no always on display.It's frustrating that Apple are taking really basic or software only things and removing it just to force people to the Pro. I don't want the useless 3x zoom lens, I don't want the titanium, I don't need the latest chip, but basic software features and a mode modern display should've made it to this phone.

    Excellent device let down by mediocre battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2022,"







  
  
    Everything about this phone is great apart from battery life. It is however as expected - have had only iPhones and they are all let down by the battery life. Yes, one can argue depends on usage and it’s true but phone users we tend to use them extensively and continually for more purposes. You lose about 30-40% of battery daily. Not a big deal now when I’ve just bought it but it will gradually deteriorate further.Other than that, it’s an excellent device. Face recognition, privacy, screen size and display, camera and quality of photographs, functionality, smooth tab transitions etc. It also looks really nice in lilac colour.Overall I love this phone, it is a quality device but battery life could somewhat be improved by Apple across the board.Final point to add is that a current reduced price reflects the worth of this iPhone 12 but the regular price is not justified whatsoever- don’t buy it at £800+ .

Here is the thing u need to know if u bought the 256gb then u won’t get it for some reason u will only get 64gb however the packaging phone is really good but if talking about charger and the pin you it won’t be in it best form specially the pin . It is super good with affordable price we are getting . If your buying this phone for any gaming then trust me it’s works really good.the bad thing about this phone is that if it reaches a certain temperature then it will start to lag but overal is really good

    Ok for what it is, scratches minimal, nice it comes with charger plug & SIM card tool but for a Grade A excellent condition refurb the battery life on the one Iv been sent is 78% which means it Proberly won’t last an awful lot longer.. the description said it should be atleast 80% it was also left behind a bin overnight by whomever delivered it!

    Details:Battery life: 91% was expecting little over 80% and this was a nice suprise.Scratches: claimed to have no scratches on the outside when held 30cm away - I held it at this distance and there were a couple of blemishes on the sides, other than that, mint condition.Performance: works just as well as my previous iPhone SE, the next step up from this phone, it is fully functional and works how expected, running the laters version of iOS.Products: it’s came well packaged, very secure and tightly wrapped in bubble wrap in a compact package.It came with: A 1m long cable and a standard one plug outlet, it came with a already fitted tempered glass screen protector which was well applied to the phone with no air bubbles and a nice few covering all of the screen, it did break a little bit while I was drunk at a party, but did it’s job protecting my phone.

    iPhone 13 Pro: Familiar but Incredibly Different
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2021,"







  
  
    This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well.

    Broken phone customer device is appalling
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2022,"







  
  
    Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn’t charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn’t work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over £1000 and still without my money or my phone.

    I normally buy the non pro version of iPhone but prices and specification with the impending  release of the iPhone 14 changed my options.I wanted the larger version iPhone 14 but the price had rocketed to £949.I was getting a slightly bigger screen but last years processor!!!The iPhone 13 Pro was available from Amazon, so I got the Pro cameras, the Pro motion display and those little extras you get with a Pro (including the sexy stainless steel for the same cash outlay £949.The Pro is amazing, the extra 6 x optical zoom lens and 15 x digital zoom lens is staggering when compared to the iPhone 12 and the whole phone looks so much better.So I ended up without a bigger screen but got so much more.I bought the blue version and I love it.

    Changed product three times
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2022,"







  
  
    I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2023,"







  
  
    Was definitely sceptical buying from Amazon renewed but decided that is was worth the risk considering the apple prices and the 30 day time window to send it back if there were any problems.The phone arrived a day early in great condition. No visible scratches anywhere on the phone. Needed a slight clean in areas but nothing too bad. Looked like some slight glue resin from a screen replacement but came off very easily. Been using the phone for a few days now and everything works perfectly. The battery was at 87% which is fine with me considering It’s relatively cheap to get a new one from apple if needed.I would recommend checking the seller reviews through Amazon when deciding which one to buy. I went through stock must go who had a 70%+ review rating I wouldn’t recommend buying anything from sellers with less than that.

There was no need to be worried, it arrived quicker than estimated and in perfect condition. Setup was nice and easy and relatively quick, it came with everything I needed and I couldn't be happier having saved a nice chunk of cash

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2022,"







  
  
    Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

    Very good phone, iOS software is not as intuitive as it used to be, and iPhones are a lot less user friendly than the Samsung I’ve switched from. I almost sent it back it was so frustrating. After time I’ve gotten used to the quirks, and not being able to do lots of things I’ve done for years on other phones. The phone itself is 4 stars because the cameras are good, but I often miss a better optical zoom Lens. And that ‘pill’ notch is just bad. 7 years ago I had a phone with no visible front camera, an edge to edge display. Catch up, Apple!

    Best Phone I’ve ever seen.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2022,"







  
  
    This iPhone is a huge step up from any other I’ve ever seen or used and I’ve had iPhones since the iPhone 3g. The camera is stunning and I’m a semi-professional photographer. I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed.This is technology at its very best and if you want the best mobile phone available today, I heartily recommend you go for this. It even has a battery that will get you through an entire long day! Not that it matters too much as I can charge mine from empty to 80% in under an hour.This isn’t the place for the kind of review this phone deserves but I can say with confidence you will not regret buying it.As a side issue, my friend and I ordered our phones on the exact same day, he from Apple and me from Amazon. I got my phone at least two weeks before he did!

    Unexpected disappointment
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2023,"







  
  
    I was hugely disappointed with the 14 max pro 256gb I had purchased recently.1. The system in settings does not correspond with the online instructions.2. Interface between the iphone system and apps and functions is awkward and counter intuitive. There is no function ""select all"" or a simple © or ° etc signs on the keyboard.3. The brand new iphone overheats while charging!!!4. There is no function to save to the home screen.5. I was unable to find instructions on how to customise my daily memory photo selection, apart from deleting the photos I do wish to see on a daily basis, and had to have this function switched off.6. The iphone email app looked very untidy and chaotic and I kept Google Gmail, which does not seem to work that well with an iPhone interface.While outwardly the iPhone presents handsome looks and some attractive features, in fact I am still unable to fully transfer my previous Android to it as it does not have the convenient features of Android I still need to use. So, in the end I have to move about with two phones: one iPhone and one Android.Buying 14 pro max was a very expensive experiment. I was hoping to upgrade my online and digital interface experience and did not realise it would bring so much stress and confusion into my life. To start with, I believe the iPhone should offer specific instructions and even warnings on the features one would lose by moving from Android to iOS.The screenshot is of the three months free appleTV subscription which came with the purchase of the phone. This is what I have got in fact, with no other options.

It's super fast and easy to use and you can take some of the best pictures whilst on the go!The price point and the added extra of the ear buds were a nice touch and I now use them daily too.Also, I find the keyboard nice to use with its haptic feedback and makes typing easier and quick than most phones.

    Finalmente ci siamo
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 14 October 2023,"







  
    Da fan dei Googlefonini ho avuto praticamente tutti i Pixel usciti fino ad oggi e devo ammettere che dopo il Pixel 5 non mi hanno mai convinto per estetica, schermo e processore, quindi in concomitanza con il restyling del design e la nascita del SoC proprietario G Tensor (base Exynos Samsung). Pare che con questa serie 8 e il Tensor G3 hanno trovato la quadra.Partiamo con il display dove hanno fatto un notevole miglioramento, netto, siamo ai livelli di un Samsung s23. Colori ben tarati, nessuna tinta strana, se inclinato non soffre di blue/red shift. Luminosità altissima. È migliorato tanto il display rispetto al Pixel 7.Altro miglioramento (per adesso) riguarda temperature e surriscaldamento durante l'utilizzo su rete mobile. Prime configurazioni e prime due giornate di utilizzo nessun problema nessuna criticità, anche l'autonomia ne guadagna e l'ho notato fin da subito (parlo sempre di utilizzo sotto rete 4g/5g), oltretutto siamo ancora al 3º giorno di commercializzazione quindi devono ancora affinare il software, e sono sicuro che migliorerà ancora. Altro miglioramento importante: costruzione e design. Assemblato in modo eccellente, è piu compatto e leggero, bordi leggermente più sottili, display più a filo con il vetro e il piccolo restyling con linee più morbide (angoli arrotondati) lo aspettavo proprio, frontalmente sembra davvero un altro smartphone rispetto al Pixel 7.Ricezione ancora devo valutare per bene ma pare sia tutto nella norma, non è ne eccellente ne problematica, se si perde la linea il riaggancio è rapido. Audio in chiamata ottimo.Piccolo miglioramento anche per quanto riguarda il lettore impronte, funziona da subito bene, anche utilizzando una pellicola in vetro trovata d'occasione qui su Amazon (che cambierò appena possibile con una clear-coat oppure una Zagg).7 anni di aggiornamenti software, roba da fare (quasi) impallidire la🍏, ma probabilmente cambierete smartphone molto prima.Aggiungo che quest'anno con la partnership Google-Uni€ur0 a breve si troveranno moltissime cover e accessori anche per i Google Pixel.Poi per quanto riguarda altre cose come audio degli speakers, fotocamera o feedback aptico, al momento mi sembra esattamente uguale al 7 ma l'8 ha molti più margini di miglioramento per quanto riguarda la fotocamera.I difetti riscontrati per ora sono gli stessi che ho avuto con tutti gli altri modelli: ricarica abbastanza lenta (27w) che nel 2023 a 800€ non è accettabile, USB Type-c 3.2 ma SENZA uscita video tramite cavo (come sempre è bloccato da Google via software), Selfie-cam solo accettabile, gestione RAM delle app in background ancora incerta, ho fatto un test con un iphone SE 2022 e su 10 app aperte il Pixel ne ricarica 5 mentre l'iPhone nemmeno una, probabilmente Google deve sistemare qualcosina tramite aggiornamento software. Infine le memorie che ""solo"" UFS 3.1 anziche 4.0, questo perí più per un discorso in ottica futura.In ogni caso valuterò il device nel tempo e sicuramente aggiornerò la recensione.

    Ottimo smartphone ma con qualche pecca
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 23 October 2023,"







  
    Ho avuto in passato nexus, dopo un periodo più o meno lungo con one+ ho deciso di tornare alle origini e di ritentare la strada android stock, questo sembrava il dispositivo giusto... NI!A livello di funzionalità nulla da dire, preso con il bundle ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, ma avviso già che mi son piaciute di più le pixel buds pro. Il pixel 8 va davvero bene, sia a livello hardware che ad usabilità generale, lo uso parecchio e in configurazione doppia sim, ma ad oggi non so se fare il reso, perché purtroppo mi cade su un dettaglio fin troppo fondamentale per il mio utilizzo: dalla scheda tecnica non sembra, ma la 🔋 dura un po troppo poco... per il mio utilizzo le 07:00 - 22:00 sono fondamentali, il telefono mi deve arrivare vivo, e faccio circa 5 ore erotte di utilizzo (mail, WhatsApp, chiamate, ricerche google, cazzeggio nei tempi morti...) non lo uso sicuramente per giocare. Detto questo mi arriva pericolosamente sotto il 10%, e con impostazioni di risparmio energetico abbastanza conservative (mi parte il risparmio energetico al 75% di batteria e tutte le app gravose sono impostate ""con limitazioni""), diciamo che da una batteria da 4600 mha e un display da 6.2 pollici speravo un po meglio, ma alla fine la giornata la faccio

    Questo Pixel 8 è un ottimo telefono sia lato software e hardware, oltreché essere molto bello!Finalmente anche lo sblocco con il volto funziona anche con le app come quelle bancarie, il che è molto comodo, e riesce ad affiancare un già buono sblocco biometrico.Come ogni Pixel all'inizio presenta qualche piccolo bug, ma sono certo che con i prossimi aggiornamenti verranno sistemati tutti.Se devo trovare un neo, avrei optato per uno schermo leggermente piu grande come un 6.4""

    Sono solo le prime impressioni essendo passati 2 giorni dall'acquisto ma sono molto positive! Il display ha dei neri decisamente profondi e un'ottima luminosità. Trovo il sensore d'impronta migliorato rispetto a P6 e P7, pur essendo ancora di tipo ottico. La qualità costruttiva è notevole. Ai livelli di Apple.

     First impressions of the phone is that it feels really good in your hand. It feels pretty premium. The screen is clear and it comes with a case. The screen is pretty good, not high end refresh rate, but good nevertheless. Android works quickly and you don't notice that this isn't a flagship phone. It comes with charging cable and adapter (not many supply one). This charges the phone at 18w, which is pretty fast.The camera is pretty good too and you can get some pretty good shots. Not so good in low light, but acceptable.I've used this phone for a week now and it is pretty good for a daily driver. I got the silver which looks amazing.I you want a pretty good phone for not that much money, this is a good one to consider.

Camera is very good and has some useful extras. The phone runs very fast and smooth, but there are a few small bugs in the firmware that I'm sure will get fixed in updates. All round a very good purchase for the price

    Looks a great phone on paper but the reality is different. In the few weeks I owned it the Bluetooth kept constantly turning off and on and got to the point that it was unusable. The phone also failed to boot up and had to have a hard reset so again wasting time setting it all up again. Sent it back and fair play to Amazon the refund was quickly sorted. Bought a Xiaomi redmi note 11pro 5g from Amazon as previous phone was Xiaomi so trusted the brand

    I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.

     Took my Pixel 8 Pro away the first weekend I got it. My pro camera didn't leave my bag. All top end smartphones these days talk about being great cameras but there was two AI assisted areas the 8 pro camera blew my mind. Astro mode for Astronomy and the stabilisation in video mode (even when zooming).I've attached some examples and the results speak for themselves. The Astronomy pictures I took were just my pixel on a tripod and nothing more, no tracker and no external stacking. Just set up, out in Night Sight mode and wait for the stars to appear on the shutter button. Then it will take a series of long exposures and process (stack) all the images took in 3-4 mins and boom, professional level dark sky photos.If you look at the video sample I uploaded too, you can see how smooth the footage is stabilised at all levels of zoom. No gimbal or grips used at all. Just gorgeous footage with minimal effort.All if this is made perfect thanks to the nee display. That extra brightness makes a huge difference when editing on the move in bright sunny scenarios.

    Bien por Google y su Pixel 8 pro. Tengo aún mi 7 pro, que con Android 14 tuvo una mejora bastante apreciable, siendo ya un gran smartphone. El 8 lo supera en pantalla, en fotografía y en velocidad y fluidez, aunque no son diferencias muy notables en el día a día. Es cierto que el brillo máximo de esta versión es tremendo, pero con el 7 nunca noté falencias. La pantalla es muy buena y la calidad de construcción muy, muy buena. Se ha refinado mucho respecto a otras generaciones. El diseño es de un Pixel. Lo amas o lo odias. Es como un iPhone, inconfundible y eso es algo que me gusta porque tiene mucho carácter. En todas las reviws cansan con la poca velocidad del procesador y la carga rápida, esto último como en Samsung y Apple. No necesito quemar la batería para que se cargue en 5 minutos. En ese sentido, estas tres marcas lo hacen bien. Yo lo uso con una base de carga inalámbrica que cuida mucho la batería. Si lo pones a cargar de noche es mejor hacerlo con un cable porque este carga hasta un 70% y detiene la carga hasta la mañana para cuidar la batería. Son detalles de android14 y del teléfono. Y bueno, se ha generalizado la expresión: es el iPhone de Google. Es cierto, ya que su interface es única y su aprovechamiento de los recursos excelente. La subida de precio de justifica? Yo creo que si. Mantener la política de precios contenidos desvaloriza el producto.Compré el de 128 GB de almacenamiento porque los de 256 y 512 tardaban mucho en llegar. En el apartado fotográfico es un 10, mucho mejor que iPhone 14 o 15 y vos a probarlo con el S23 ultra, aunque es una batalla difícil, porque el Samsung es verdaderamente una bestia en todo los aspectos a un precio similar con 256gb de RAM. Creo que ahí se pudo ajustar más el precio y dejar los 128 GB a unos 900€. Es mi opinión. El almacenamiento es muy importante porque también afecta al rendimiento del teléfono, pero suelo tener todo en la nube y es una solución a medias. El tema es el apartado fotográfico. Yo tiro todo en Raw. Es decir en calidad máxima lo que implica un formato en bruto, sin perdida de información, con la pega de que una foto de 50 mega pixeles, pasa de tener 2 o 3 megas en jpg, a más de 10 según la foto y el formato.Conclusión, un producto excelente pero no para todo el mundo. Si quieres usarlo como gamer y que cargue echando humo la batería, este no es tu teléfono. Si quieres un producto de calidad, equilibrado, eficiente y con pantalla y cámara pro, este es tu teléfono.Ah, se me olvida. El 7 pro pecaba de una batería muy justa para mi gusto. En este es estupenda. Hay una diferencia muy importante en la duración y carga de la batería si lo conectas a un cargador.En resumen, lo recomiendo al 100% si te gusta la experiencia de Android casi puro, eso es una pasada, y tener un teléfono eficiente en todos los de todos. Otra cosa es el sonido. Impresionante la mejora respecto a la versión anterior. Tien un sonido con cuerpo y potente, casi equiparable a un iPhone, aunque el último que probé, el 14 pro Max, no me pareció tan brillante en este aspecto.Muy recomendable.

    Come temperature ci siamo, sicuramente meglio di Pixel 7 Pro che era un fornellino portatile.Per ora la batteria mi sembra che vada giù piu rapidamente ma aspetto di avere un riscontro di almeno una settimana.Complessivamente è poco piu del 7 Pro, un po piu stondato nei bordi, ma la solita minestra, niente di WOW (il sensore di temperatura è inutile)Seguiranno sicuramente aggiornamenti.

    Tras un par de días de uso intensivo puede decirse que seguramente sea el mejor móvil del mercado actualmente.La mejor cámara, incluso superando la del nuevo iPhone y un rendimiento extraordinario, con una experiencia de usuario Android inigualable. Las posibilidades de edición de imagen y asistente que ofrece Google no se pueden comparar con ningún otro fabricante.La batería llega perfectamente al final del día, aunque si es cierto que la carga no es muy rápida.El precio es superior al de salida de otros modelos aunque se compensa algo con la promoción inicial de los auriculares.Actualmente no hay nada a su nivel y menos por este precio.

    Ich habe das Google Pixel 8 Pro mit meinem alten OnePlus 8T verglichen. Das OnePlus hat Android 13 mit Pixel Experience installiert, daher ist die Software und das Interface nahezu identisch.In Bezug auf die Leistung ist der Snapdragon 865 des OnePlus 8T dem Tensor G3 des Pixel 8 Pro ebenbürtig. Der Tensor G3 ist zwar etwas schneller, aber der Unterschied ist nicht spürbar. In Spielen ist der Tensor G3 nur mittelmäßiig, was aber zu erwarten war.Die größten Unterschiede liegen beim Display, der Kamera und den Lautsprechern. Das Display des Pixel 8 ist deutlich heller und kontrastreicher als das des OnePlus 8T. Die Kamera des Pixel 8 Pro ist ebenfalls deutlich besser, insbesondere bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen. Die Lautsprecher des Pixel 8 Pro sind zudem sehr gut und bieten einen satten Klang.Zu den Nachteilen des Pixel 8 Pro gehören die Wärmeentwicklung und die Akkulaufzeit. Das Smartphone wird bei einfachen Aufgaben wie App-Updates warm. Der Akku hält nur einen Tag, ohne Reserve.Insgesamt ist das Pixel 8 Pro ein gutes Smartphone, aber es bietet nicht genug Fortschritt, um den Preis zu rechtfertigen. Das Display ist das Highlight, aber das Smartphone fühlt sich nicht wie ein Flaggschiff des Jahres 2023 an.

Overall impressions for the first day, battery from this morning until now at 8 pm is at 75% which is great, tested the cameras and they are very sharp, the phone is super fast, very loud and clear speakers, one thing that i don't like but its not only this phone, but all Pixels, is that there isn't a dedicated gallery app like on most phones, is just google photos.

    A little bit sticky on the keys  and face recognition is - a pain
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2023,"







  
  
    Hard to know as one who wears glasses whether to take them off to leave them on for facial recognition.  Generally, on ... but my word it's a pain if you're using your phone in bed sans glasses and having to key in the password each time.  Isn't there an option for either -or in the advanced world of Appledom? The phone itself is quite nice but not as intuitive as I'd hoped and I'm still working out how to edit the Home Screen and add stuff I really want rather than stuff inflicted on me.  I pine my old iPhone 6, yes 6, which went without updates for so long and yet still performed relatively well.  Big mistake to buy the salmon pink cover for such a pretty blue phone too.

    Works but not ‘excellent’ condition
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2023,"







  
  
    The phones works but the battery life is only 80 percent. The phone is advertised as excellent condition and will work and look pretty much as new… except this phone had a million scratches on the rim all the way around and was marked as a grade B on the box - which had been crossed out but I could still see. It also said 80 percent battery on the box - again crossed out but not well enough.The back and the front of the phone looked good so in a case it wasnt really that bad.Considering iPhone costs, it’s a ok phone but I wouldnt advertise as excellent and looks as new because it will just cause more complaints! I nearly sent it back when I saw the battery life and all the scratches!!- lucky I was desperate!  If this was excellent I’d hate to see the condition of the ‘good’ option. But overall it does work and in the case looks all good!

    So a bit of history about me that led me to buying this.  I have had pretty much every iphone since they first appeared.  The 4/4s and 5 remain my favourite.  The mIni shares many design cues with those which was part of th eappeal.However the real appeal was that I wanted a small, light premium phone after lugging my iphone 11 around since it came out.So I took the plunge and decided to get the 12 mini despite it being a drastic drop in screen size and on arrival I wonder if I had done the right thing.The phone comes in the usual premium Apple packaging minus a charger which is fine.  I went for the white one, and its more off white but stunning.Immediately it felt at home in my hand.  Setup is mega easy, I just turned it on next to my 11 and about half hour later all my apps, photos and settings were transferred.  Some additional setup was needed for banking apps and signing into Apple Pay but thats fine and expected.Its light and the design is spot on.  I started to have a play and contrast against my 11 and initially i felt it was the wrong choice but now the 11 feels completely alien to me.The OLED screen is lovely and the difference by comparison to my 11 is amazing.  A few videos latter and the screen has won me over.The key point for me is using it one handed is a joy again.  Moving about the gym with it is a joy again, generally living with it so far has been joyful.The camera is superb and in particular low light pictures are a win.Battery life, it has a small battery.  As an 'average' user I get through the day fine.  At a push I could get almost 2 days out of my 11, this wont do that but gets me through my average day.  When I'm int he car using carplay the phone is charging, in fact most places I have access to charge if need be.The build quality is fantastic.  Every bit the premium phone and this time I went for white which I am loving.I have encountered one issue that has been reported on by the tech press, and that is if you fit a screen protector and a case, there is an intermittent issue where the screen doesnt respond to a swipe.  I notice that maybe one in ten swipes to unlock requires me to reswipe.  Hoping Apple resolve this with a software fix and that it is not hardware.  Though Apple I know are better than most offering support programs to fix any problems.Overall, the camera, screen and build are amazing and this is the perfect phone for me against a trend of making phones bigger and bigger.  There are compromises such as average battery and the aforementioned problem.  Theres even 5g support when that becomes available.

    Great replacement for my old 5s
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 June 2022,"







  
  
    After my 5s it took some time to adjust and I miss the thumb recognition, especially as covid hit and masks became necessary. The mask face recognition is hit and miss. When using apple pay in stores this can be an inconvenience.The battery is far superior to my 5s, but is still lacking when in heavy use.I also miss the audio jack, I've had this phone 4 months now and really need to find some wireless headphones. I rarely use headphones so cheap £5 plug-in's were so much more convenient to me, than having something extra to keep charged up.But overall I love this phone, it's fast, faster than my laptop in processing speeds. It's the perfect size as I need a  phone, not a small tablet in my pocket.The screen and camera are great, the photos are as good as any camera I've had. And it's a pleasure to watch movies on.It has a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 metres up to 30 minutes)My phone did get wet once (dropped while reading in the bath) and I went to charge it later and a warning came up telling me to let it dry. I've had zero issues since, so I'm very impressed by this.**********Edit after nearly a year of ownership.My new phone accidentally found its way in the washing machine. I thankfully realised quickly and got it out within 5 minutes and after drying out it works as well as it ever has. Amazing. I thought it was a goner.Also the mask/face recognition issue has been greatly improved with updates.I still occasionally miss the audio jack, but it’s not worth losing a star over so I’m upgrading my rating to 5*.

    Going from a 10R to a 12 mini.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2020,"







  
  
    Coming from a 10R to a 12 mini.The 10R was one of the best iPhones I’ve ever had, it was the first time I was introduced to the edge to edge display and the game changing Face ID and the best battery iv ever had in an iPhone, there technically wasn’t anything wrong with my 10R but my dad has an iPhone 4 and is not one to go out and buy himself a new phone but wait till one of us hands him down one of our old ones and when I saw the 12 mini it intrigued me! So I decided to go for it and get one (and I’ll give my dad my old 10R.... good son or what!) tho there was a couple of things I was worried about, one: how would I feel going from a bigger phone to a smaller one and two: going from the best battery in an iPhone to one not so grate, well iv had this phone for a week now and.... I love it! The size is not a major difference really, only by an inch or two I think, but the small iPhone 5 like body with the iPhone 10 display is brilliant and just looks and feels like an iPhone should, I thought with going with a smaller display I would need to increase the text size for my ageing eyes but i found this isn’t necessary and the small body with the iPhone 5 flat edges rather than curved ones we’ve had since iPhone 6 feels grate in the hand and I’m able to do something iv not done in a while... use my phone with the one hand! The next thing was battery, iv actually watched a battery drain test video on YouTube and was surprised to see the 12 mini died the same time as the 10R and all week iv been paranoidly checking my battery health to see how fast it’s going down and I’m finding that it’s lasting just as long as my 10R did ending the day with just over half the battery left (this is with my own general use, not a heavy user and don’t play games) so I was really chuffed about that!All in all this is a grate phone and I’d say my best iPhone yet and I’m glad I went for it.

    Upgrade from iPhone 8 - haven’t looked back
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2021,"







  
  
    I bought my last iPhone (iPhone 8) back not long after it was released so I was definitely due an upgrade. I purchased the 12 mini when it was on offer during Prime Day - and I’m so glad I did. I’d forgotten what it’s like to have a phone that actually lasts all day - the 8 required mid-day charges quite quickly after I bought it so I had chargers dotted all around my life for convenience. I think I’ve only had to use them with the 12 mini a couple of times in the months I’ve had it.Other plus points - it’s fast, 128gb storage means I no longer have to offload apps to save space, and the size is absolutely perfect - it fits in my jeans front pocket easily (the “normal” 12 is too big for your pocket to be comfortable. I’m a huge advocate that if I want a big screen I’ll use my iPad - my iPhone is for convenience, messaging and calls.The camera is brilliant - has lifted my photos to a whole new level. I must admit though, I don’t rate the wide angle lens much - it creates a bit of a fish-eye distort to pictures which I’m not a fan of. The decent front facing camera is great for selfies though. And I really love portrait mode how it blurs the background behind the subject.This is my first phone with FaceID. Mixed opinion - in many ways it’s nice and convenient - when it works. But if for some reason it’s having a moment and doesn’t recognise your face, it’s a pain. I’d say I have more difficulty opening my phone with faceid than I have ever had with TouchID. Given the choice I’d go back to touch. And when wearing a face mask it’s a pain!All in all, I’m very happy with my new phone and I’m expecting it to last many years.

    Excellent small iPhone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2020,"







  
  
    Review UPDATED December 2020.Been using the device for almost 4 weeks now and thought the review needed an update.The device is really nice to hold in the hand. Very compact and well built. I have been after a good small phone and this has been excellent. Beautiful display clarity and brightness. Notch is still there but if you buy one of these iPhones then I am assuming you are ok with it.Overall performance is excellent and I decided to keep the device. I also had the pixel 4a which is another excellent small phone. Very comparable in a lot of ways but obviously huge price difference. If you are after a high end, compact smartphone then you should be happy with the mini.I’ve had 5G off since day one. It is not really available in most places as of right now and drains battery quicker. My brightness is set to auto. Dark mode set to auto turn on and off with dusk and dawn. With all the above in mind, the small battery has been excellent. No exaggeration at all. Battery life is fantastic. I am as surprised as anyone! There are days I get easily over 6 hours screen on time and more. I have Bluetooth on all times and connected to my galaxy watch. WiFi on pretty much all day as I work from home. Have not had any issues with battery, which was my main worry before buying the mini.Now please keep in mind that I am not a gamer on my phone. I do not play high end games. My battery life has been based on normal usage. Phone calls, emails, web browsing, some streaming services, music and using the camera. Just normal day to day stuff. Very pleasantly surprised. Comfortably making a full day and then some.Excellent small phone and I would highly recommend.

    Surprisingly Good
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 May 2022,"







  
  
    I have used this as a daily phone for a number of days now and so far the battery has been fine. Some reviews did make me worry. Recently had the battery replaced on my GF's old iPhone for £55 so even if this modest battery does conk out after a couple of years (if some of these reviews are to be taken seriously) then i think I can cope with the low expense of a replacement. I use the phone for calls, texts on various apps, and pretty heavy use of Discord and its been great. Despite it's small size I haven't had too much trouble texting but admittedly it is currently more difficult than my older huge 6.5 inch screen zenfone. I will get used to the size and I will get used to using ioS and then will be able to use the phone as proficiently as an android.The only bad thing is colours look bland but that is half because of the fact I tend to over saturate my phones and tv pictures because I like a colourful screen. The screen can be made 'warmer' however but it certainly isn't as adjustable as an android. There may be apps available that can help but like I say am new to ios.The product red colour really pops.Face recognition makes life so easy too. I prefer it to finger print ( a function this iphone does not have) .

    Good phone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2022,"







  
  
    I said I’d never ever spend anywhere near £600 for a phone but I found this and thought I haven’t had a brand new phone for years and if I can afford it then why not. I’ve also never had one with so much storage so I found myself downloading apps and games that I probably won’t use. I’ve had rose gold/pink phones for years now so thought I’d come away from that as I liked the purple. I also decided to pay it off in the 5 monthly instalments to make it even easier.It arrived quickly and I was eager to get it set up..However.. it doesn’t come with a plug.. so I then had to go out to my nearest supermarket and spend even more money on a charging plug so I could actually turn it on. I  upgraded from a 6s so I couldn’t even use that one. For the amount of money you spend Apple should still at least give you the full charging accessory.After setting it up I had a little play around as it’s got some extra things I hadn’t had before. Sound is decent, screen size is good, overall phone size is good. Face recognition works well..It’s overall a pretty good phone with the bonus of the nice colour instead of plain white or black.

    The best small iPhone to date!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2021,"







  
  
    Apple iPhone 12 mini 128gb £599 from Amazon Prime. A great deal to good to pass up. Was considering the iPhone SE 64gb £399 or £449 for the 128gb, but when I saw this mini at a reduced  price it made more sense now. Original price for iPhone 12 mini 64gb at £699 which is £300 more than the SE version so the question is, is the mini 12 worth £300 more than the SE? NO! Is it worth £150 more? That’s an astounding YES! So go and treat yourself to the best small iPhone from Amazon prime.Review update: Started watching The Walking Dead season 9 and thought I’ll test the iPhone mini 12 battery life. So after fully charged 100% I continued watching using the Prime app from season 9, episode 6, 54min  episode 7, 43min  episode 8, 44min  episode 9, 51min  episode 10, 45min  episode 11, 41min  episode 12, 44min  episode 13, 40min  episode 14, 45min  episode 15, 57min  episode 16, 46minIn between episodes Amazon throws in around 30sec ads for other TV series. The iPhone mini 12 still had 15% ( red ) and I recharged using the official Apple 20w usb-c charger, and it took a little over 2hrs to fully charge to 100%. Honestly I don’t see any issues with battery life. It’s a small phone so naturally comes with a small battery, but after this showing I’m impressed.

    Sleek fast and you don’t need a backpack to carry it around
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2021,"







  
  
    Great phone, I wanted a phone I could comfortably use that wasn’t as massive as the other phones on the market today. I’m a swipe to text guy so the 12 mini is perfect as it’s easy to text one handed. The screen is great, bright and crisp and is super responsive. Forget the reviews who say it’s only 60hz refresh rate. There’s nothing you will be doing on your phone that’s over 60hz, it’s a phone not a gaming pc so it handles everything perfectly.I was concerned about the potential battery life before I bought the phone but I can honestly say it’s never died on me. My average phone screen time is about 3 hours day so I end up charging it every day and a half to 2 days. I bought an apple plug so I could fast charge and it charges nice and fast ( not as fast as my previous one plus 5t ).The main reason I bought the iPhone 12 mini instead of a new Samsung or even the latest oneplus offering was, the Samsung is absolutely massive. The oneplus ( albeit cheaper and good bang for buck ) just couldn’t compare to the camera quality and overall user experience.People ask me how I can watch movies and videos on a screen that’s this size and my honest answer is: I have 4K TVs for a reason. My phone is used as a phone and camera, some email and web browsing and small amounts of media consumption here and there, Netflix or YouTube binges are reserved for the tv

    It's a one-handed iPhone
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2021,"







  
  
    The iPhone 12 Mini’s build quality, speed and task handling are the same to my untrained eye as the Max’s. Indeed, the oddest observation I can make is the zero difference I have experienced reading, texting and photo editing compared to the larger iPhone.Reading social media feeds is no different at all. Text on the iPhone 12 Mini doesn’t seem smaller in day to day use. Perhaps it might do in a side-by-side comparison.Using the iPhone 12 Mini is a joy. It is bliss when leaving home with a phone that slips into a pocket and stays unnoticed.The Mini is light even when compared to my wife’s iPhone 11 Pro. I can’t believe how much heavier my wife’s Pro phone feels.So far, so good.The iPhone 12 Mini works with MagSafe accessories and is capable of fast charging, so at least I haven’t wasted the expense of those items (Apple MagSafe Wallet and Charger).Unlike the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the Mini is comfortable to hold, easier to type on and works.But, there’s always a but.There are only two issues that weaken my long-term commitment to the concept of an iPhone Mini-sized phone:No telephoto lens - I miss some photo opportunities.A weaker battery - Always start the day on a full charge to avoid getting caught out.I don't regret buying the Mini, especially when Amazon cut the price by £100. But in an ideal world, I'd prefer an iPhone Mini Pro.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2022,"







  
  
    Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.

    As usual, I bought it impulsively, the only excuse was that my previous  iPhone had 86%battery capacity. And the Amazon price was excellent:).No regrets, this one feels and handles better from many aspects : great battery life, bigger screen, snappier .I don’t take routinely photos with the phone therefore I wasn’t particularly interested in the camera quality. From some random photos taken seems to be excellent.It is very important to get a good quality case , otherwise will feel bulky and difficult to fit into a shirt or tight jeans pocket (I’m not wearing  tight jeans).Definitely recommend , not sure if it is a significant upgrade from iPhone12 but… why not?

    The screen is so crystal clear 😍 the chrome sides are stunning! The battery is fantastic and the camera is so clear and it’s so fast.The only cons I would say is the phone is so heavy and the camera stick out quite a bit. But personally I don’t mind it too much! It’s something that I will get used to over time.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2023,"







  
  
    These speakers are great quality. I use this in the kitchen/diner for music when cooking, cleaning and having guests over. Its never too quiet, the sound can fill the whole room with good quality and have more to give.There is integration to Amazon Alexa and to Goggle Assistant. I found the Google integration was completely useless and did not work at all, that was my preferred option so had to go with Alexa in the end. That being said, the Alex integration works perfect with no issues. Although i do find the voice control sometimes does not work top tier. I'm not bothered about that, but you may of course be.For me the sound is what i judge this speaker on. SONOS also provide the SONOS home app on your phone. This is actually pretty good and kind of works like spotify. Essentially a free streaming service for music with ads unless you buy premium. I dont tend to use it but did give it a go and liked all the curated playlists and radio stations they have made.

    Ive just recently ordered another sonos one, going quadraphoic. The gen 2 ones are a great sound speaker by themselves, the quality is superior to most small speakers, I've purchased a few small BT speaker over the years, then bought a sondcore boom, a absolutely serious BT speaker. I use it in my truck. But any whoos, Hifi has always been my passion,bought my sonos one gen 2 last year,was very impressed, then bought the mini sub (its not mini) game changer.they say this is a budget system, I disagree this is high end.And I know you can spend thousands on sound systems. If you love music, and want a perfect music system that won't disappoint, i so recommend this, the good thing is you can buy it bit by bit. Cannot possibly give a better review than this, other than you coming round my house and listening for yourself. Fidelity bass clarity, first  class.

    I got one... two... then three...
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2020,"







  
  
    I started with just one of these speakers. First thoughts its easy to set up. App is reliable, makes it super easy to play music.I then brought a second to create a stereo pair... that was the WOW factor. It completely changes the listening experience. The audio sounds so much richer. I was shocked on how much it changed the music I was playing and now there's two we havent actually gone above 50% volume 🤭 because its so loud.We was so impressed we brought a third for the bedroom. Now I can play music everywhere while I'm wondering around and doing the house work!My issues with these speakers... all three of them in fact.ALEXA just seems to have bugs on Sonos.1st. If your broadband drops, well Alexa will refuse to reconnect, she just constantly says something along the lines ""i'm struggling to connect at the moment, please check your Internet connection"". The weird thing is the Sonos side works fine and reconnects fine after a drop. E.g. I can play music via the app. You are forced to restart all the speaker everytime the internet drops to rekick in the Alexa integration.2nd. Some features are limited compared to Amazons own devices. E.g. Alexa cant phone people. You can't connect any multirooms with Amazons own alexa devices.3rd. Alexa just randomly does not play music when you ask her to. ""Alexa, play music from Harry's Spotify account"" and then she just stops... Check the Alexa app... and she heard me perfectly and understood (you can see your speech against text on how alexa understood what you asked).Although we have now got to a point where we just don't use Alexa, which isn't a big deal for us but might be for others. All said, Generally Sonos is a fantastic eco system and Sonos Ones don't fall short from what you should expect from the brand.

    Fantastic little speaker, allows use of Alexa without need for Echo or Dot devices.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,"







  
  
    Having taken the plunge to install some smart lights and sockets, when I read about this product it appeared that the Alexa voice component was for use with audio features however it also allows us to use voice control of anything that ""she"" is linked to. Once we had added the Sonos skill to Alexa we did not need the Echo in our kitchen any longer and were able to re-purpose it in another room.The unit itself is very smart, small, satin black plastic in appearance with the metal grill around the middle outer surface. The sound from such a small device is however very clear, crisp and has a surprisingly rich bass to it for the size. At higher volumes it is not as good as the larger Play5 unit but common sense dictates that at the end of the day.Touch controls on the top surface are very easy to use, regardless of how dry, damp or greasy your fingers may be but it would be advisable to only use dry and clean hands to prevent muck being deposited into the ring of very small holes that constitute aperture for the microphone array.When using voice control the speaker can be trained with the Alexa app to better understand a particular user's voice however the generic ""out the box"" settings work perfectly for all my family as none of us have strong regional dialects. I cannot speak for anyone from Newcastle or Glasgow but when I was reading the reviews on this unit on some hifi websites they did state that for such accents the training would be beneficial so that it does not keep moaning about not understanding voice commands. Just be aware that if you put the unit in a corner and run it at anything about about 6/10 on the volume scale then it is likely it will not respond to voice at all as the system will be making so much noise that it may not accurately hear your commands.
