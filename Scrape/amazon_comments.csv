    The sweet spot in the current lineup
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2023,"







  
  
    Finally rid of the notch and lightning connection. The reason I purchased this.Nicely boxed with tamper sealingComplete with a Braided usb-c lead accessory which is cool.Has the usual sim pin included in the UK.I wish the telecoms market would get their act together on eSIM.Colour, I had intended to get boring black but I chose a pastel Matt Green with the glossy apple logo to the rear. Chosen more due to the fact that the other colours had sold out but I actually like it now I‚Äôve got it and its colour is concealed in my OtterBox Strada case anyway.On opening, the first thing you will notice is how lightweight the phone is and in my position only weighed down by the case weight.You will notice the dual cameras are very pronounced and the phone doesn‚Äôt lay flat on a surface.My case offers excellent protection for the lenses and allows it to lay flush.The iPhone has an aluminium casing with lovely rounded edges.Set up for my experience. This was the painful part.Transferring data from my iPhone 11 was not the easiest of tasks and I had to take an update to the fifteen before it would initiate the transfer process.However Once completed my new phone was near identical in appearance and usability apart from one or two apps that required setting up again.The Home Screen is large, bright and colourful is blessed with something called the Dynamic island which alters its size and shape dependent on the app that requires it.This is a great feature introduced to recent Apple phones and transforms the viewing experience when watching content playback of the likes  of Prime, Netflix, Disney etc.It is finally a really enjoyable viewing experience now the dreaded notch has gone.Some have mentioned a lower refresh rate on this model compared to the Pro models but is not a noticeable problem for me.Not just watching but the Sound quality even at low volumes is brilliant particularly when watching movies.Watch Blade Runner 2049 or rather listen to it on the Apple app is a totally immersive experience even without AirPods.Officer K‚Äôs visit to the Wallace Corporation‚Äôs Earth Headquarters has great depth and echo as he exchanges dialogue with the file clerk and Luv in its large halls.iOS 17 standby mode is slightly disappointing down to the exclusivity of the pro models only having an always on display. But this is the only real disappointment of this model.The ability to plug in USB devices and exchange data or charge or receive power from other devices is a real step forward.Battery life is phenomenal. End of!Doesn‚Äôt get hot when charging and lasts ages. Unless you have got it glued to your face you can expect a couple of days between charges for average use and when the battery is new of course.I have some older wireless chargers that are struggling a bit to charge through the mag safe case with the phone attached.This hasn‚Äôt been an issue before with my other phones. I haven‚Äôt got a new type mag safe charger yet and is not really a phone issueThe camera has several new features including automatically picking out portraits without specifically switching to portrait mode.It has a up to 48 mega pixel camera and with iOS 17 can produce bokeh effect portraits.There are some brilliant video modes including a live action sports type mode.4K or HD recording and frame rate adjustment.

    It comes with no charger, but with charging cable.
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2023,"







  
  
    Received the iPhone 15 plus for a friend of mine only to find that apple have been stingy and not provided a charging plug but they supply the cable. It‚Äôs ironic that if you buy an iPad from apple you will get a charging plug but not for the iPhone which costs twice as much as an iPad. Obviously I have had to order a charging plug separately but legally apple are selling something that technically is not fit for purpose because if you don‚Äôt have any means of charging the iPhone then it‚Äôs practically no good to you. Secondly there was no mention of what is supplied with the iPhone so it could be classed as mis-selling. Is this apple trying to be revengeful against the EU who forced them to have a usb-c socket instead of an eight pin blade on their iPads and iPhones. I expect so!

    Es lohnt sich vonseiten der Kamera
  
  
",Reviewed in Germany on 27 September 2023,"







  
    Wie jedes Jahr wollte ich mir nicht das neue iPhone kaufen und habs mir ‚Äì wie jedes Jahr ‚Äì doch gekauft.ü§£ü•≥Dieses Mal wurde es die gelbe Plus Version. Ich hatte vorher das 14 plus.Allein von der Kamera her lohnt sich der Umstieg. Das 15+ macht Fotos wie fr√ºher nur die Pro Modelle. f√ºr mich als Wenigfotografierer lohnt sich ein Pro nicht.Das Plus hat gegen√ºber den normalen 15ern aber auch schon mehr Akkulaufzeit.Was f√ºr mich weiterhin Sinn macht, ist der USB C Anschluss, da ich im Besitz eines iPad Pro bin und auch im Besitz eines MacBook, so dass ich jetzt alles mit dem gleichen Kabel laden kann.Die R√ºckseite ist etwas matter und der Apfel nicht mehr silber auf der R√ºckseite. Das ist das einzige, was mir nicht so gut gef√§llt optisch. Aber das ist jammernnauf hohem Niveau.Von mir nat√ºrlich klare Kaufempfehlung ü§£ü•≥Kleiner Wermutstropfen an dem ganzen System. Update ist, dass bei der Apple Watch die Batterieanzeige und das anpingen vom unteren Bildschirmrand nicht mehr geht. Aber das hat mit dem Handy an sich nichts zu tun.

    I‚Äôve had this phone for a few weeks and no major problems so far. Arrived a day earlier than expected which was a bonus. Looks as good aa new, no marks or scratches. Only real concern is that the max capacity of the battery is only 83%. Not that it was mis-sold it‚Äôs just that my last reconditioned phone (also from Amazon) had battery capacity of 100%. This said, battery life is much better on this phone than my previous iPhone.

    Great Phone, Amazing service, shame about the damage that shouldn't have been there
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 July 2022,"







  
  
    It's a shame that I have to combine my experience of the phone as a functioning device, the state it was delivered in and the quality of service.The level of service was exemplary. I had an issue (a nasty scrape in the edge of the screen with a few tiny dints that whilst almost invisible, showed up when applying a screen protector), which was dealt with by customer services within minutes of me raising it with Amazon. Truly the best customer service I've ever encountered. Polite and helpful with a positive outcome. If there had been a replacement phone available, I would have accepted it without hesitation and I feel very safe in buying from this seller, Buyur, again.The phone itself is exactly what regular iPhone users have come to expect. The OLED screen is really bright and the colours are deeper. The resolution is noticeably better, which I didn't think I would be able to detect.I've never used facial recognition as a lock before and I'm still a bit skeptical about it. I still prefer a fingerprint sensor. A rear sensor, like some android handsets, would have been a clever option. I'm not the first one to say this.I've only considered upgrading due to the impending OS update that no longer supports anything before the iPhone 8. Apart from anything else, I like to be able to service my own phones and the later generations have the unreasonable locking of parts to the CPU.

    Almost met the description
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2022,"







  
  
    At first glance this phone looked good. It was meant to be in excellent condition, but there were some specks on the colour of the phone. This was only very minor so we overlooked it at everything else seemed spot on.Thereafter we noticed that when we came to use the camera it wasn't working properly and later discovered the flash light also wasn't working. Assuming this was perhaps a software issue we tried resetting, which fixed some elements of the issue but not all. After trying different reset options we decided to contact Apple who asked us to bring it into store. There we discovered that the camera itself needed replacing and during a fully diagnostic test that the battery was also not very good considering the excellent condition implying that the battery should have been much better.We reached out to the seller to reimburse the ~¬£150 repair costs with Apple who provided a trade in price of ¬£130. The seller offered to repair it themselves with non Apple parts, but at this point we were a bit disheartened that it had been misold to us and decided it was probably easier to just find a new phone and not have to deal with all these issues. Not a great first experience with refurbished sales.

    ¬†I purchased this iPhone 14 Starlight at a good price, and I am delighted! It is at really good aesthetic condition, the screen is like brand new. It takes really good videos and pictures. It presents a minor tiny scratch on the metal lateral part, but I didn't really notice because I kept the phone case cover on top. Absolute satisfied with this product.I really appreciated the packaging even if it was not from the original apple packaging. The delivery was super fast, from the purchase it took only 3 days. I am very satisfied and I hope this review can help the seller to improve their revenues. üòÄüëç

    Other than the fact I received a Chinese model the phone works well and has good battery life. BUT the main reason I‚Äôm returning this or hopefully exchanging (if possible) is because Chinese models of iPhone does not allow FaceTime audio calling.

No faults or issues.The battery health is over 80% (mine came with 88% battery health).Literally no scratches, which is surprising because it is renewed.Came with a USB-C to lightning charger cable and the sim card removal tool thing.Overall, works great.

    Excellent device let down by mediocre battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2022,"







  
  
    Everything about this phone is great apart from battery life. It is however as expected - have had only iPhones and they are all let down by the battery life. Yes, one can argue depends on usage and it‚Äôs true but phone users we tend to use them extensively and continually for more purposes. You lose about 30-40% of battery daily. Not a big deal now when I‚Äôve just bought it but it will gradually deteriorate further.Other than that, it‚Äôs an excellent device. Face recognition, privacy, screen size and display, camera and quality of photographs, functionality, smooth tab transitions etc. It also looks really nice in lilac colour.Overall I love this phone, it is a quality device but battery life could somewhat be improved by Apple across the board.Final point to add is that a current reduced price reflects the worth of this iPhone 12 but the regular price is not justified whatsoever- don‚Äôt buy it at ¬£800+ .

The phone came late, I was told it would arrive on the 29th Nov but due to strikes it came on the 2nd Dec, I'm happy it at least came in the end.The phone itself is great so far, easy transfer from my old iPhone 6s and the face recognition is pretty much instant only issue is it came with 87% battery health.I got a free charger that came with it, plug and wire.

    Great Value not so Great Battery
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020,"







  
  
    I got the product and it was in perfect condition. No scratches or anything on the body which did really surprise me. The only problem was that the battery health was at 83% but for what is basically a half price phone, even in October 2020, this isn‚Äôt too much of an issue. It‚Äôs still worth it even if I have to replace the battery. Would recommend if you want a top phone on a smaller budget.  Face Recognition is insanely fast i was very surprised as i‚Äôm used to the touch ID on older apple phones. However for anyone using this for apple pay, it doesn‚Äôt work with a mask on so you‚Äôll have to type your passcode.  OLED screen is fantastic and I would say it‚Äôs the best feature of the phone. However for those who aren‚Äôt too bothered by this you may not really notice too much difference from the LCD screens on the lower market iPhones.  Doesn‚Äôt come in Original packaging and doesn‚Äôt come with the earphones for anyone wondering. It did include a charging brick and charging cable.  I personally love the 3D touch on this phone that they removed on the iPhone 11 range if that‚Äôs something that you enjoy.  I was slightly worried when i ordered it but that it would come and not be in a good condition. However after using this for a few days i can confirm that this is an all round good buy and would recommend. Would have given 5 stars if the batter health was above 95%.

    bought it six months ago and immediately the battery wasn't healthy and began to deteriorate very quickly and in the end would just switch off. arranged to send it back to the seller and when he received it he said that due to the phone being damaged by me, he would not fix it - I had not damaged the phone and the phone was fine when I sent it.The seller was very unhelpful to the point I had to ask Amazon to step in and help me with the matter which they did.Be cautious here when buying as you may not get the phone you thought it would be and also guarantee is quickly cancelled when you need to use it.

    Great phone with very few marks on the screen, nothing major to affect use. However, when turning the phone on, Apple detects the battery has been changed and a non genuine battery has been used, therefore not displaying the battery health. I‚Äôve been through the listing to double check, and nowhere does it mention the battery being changed. It does however guarantee a battery life of more than 80%, something I‚Äôm unable to check now.

Screen froze and calls cut off.Seller absolutely appalling and unhelpful. I purchased this with free returns, and the seller refused to send a label. Amazon said they would cover the cost to return. So I purchased postage. Amazon then refused to refund the postage costs.AVOID this seller completely ignored messages from myself and instructions from Amazon who are powerless to do anything against them.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2023,"







  
  
    I didn‚Äôt expect much with such a low cost phone from Amazon, but it somewhat surprised me! The battery life was at 100% maximum capacity (which is very rare for phones that aren‚Äôt brand new from apple or a large company), the screen quality is quite decent - but the glare on it is quite odd? Looking at it from the side, the screen seems quite bright and dark things look a light grey, alongside seeming too dark in some places. The back of the phone heats up when it‚Äôs on charge or used on charge (which is fair enough)Overall, pretty good phone.

    The phone was delivered promptly. It was in good condition the only blemish I have noticed is a small chip on the bottom right hand corner edged. It did not come with the tool needed to insert the sim card as promised which would have been a problem had I not had this tool from my previous phone.  It seem to work well except for the ""home button"" which does work but feels as if it my have some fault as it does not operate with the same feel as my previous phone. Hopefully this is nothing to be concerned about. Time will tell. Otherwise satisfied so far.

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2022,"







  
  
    So, I had just brought this phone a good two months ago and I have never been so pleased with a phone before. I had come from a Samsung S10e and if any of you knew that phone, you would know it is a small and very compact phone. My battery life on the Samsung was really bad, so I had decided to get an iPhone 11. Happy to say that I don't regret buying it.I had got the initial phone for ¬£480 ish as I brought the 128gb version, since I needed the storage. I have barely used half of the storage too, which is good. The battery is actually good, it goes down gradually as the hours pass, but sometimes I notice that if I keep certain apps like Spotify opened up for a long time, the battery tends to go down faster, but that's probably because I have Spotify on 24/7. However, on a normal day, the battery basically lasts for most of the day.I had a hard time trying to adjust to the new phone and its' new functions, but I had quickly gotten used to it as I used it more and more. Obviously this is common knowledge but I don't like that Apple had gotten rid of the earphone jack. That annoyed me. But the sound is amazing on this phone.The camera is pretty decent too, it feels like I have a professional camera in my phone. The camera has many functions to suit different people's needs when it comes to having a camera in their phone. I have taken some really nice shots with my phone, and my friends could not believe that it came from my iPhone.Not going to lie, I used to be a Samsung fanboy, so I would always put Apple down for their phones and say that Samsung was better. However, that is now the contrary. I am absolutely pleased with the phone, and I know everyone hypes up iPhones, and yeah, to an extent, it shouldn't be hyped up that much, but, in my experience, this is a rock solid phone and I recommend buying it if you can't afford the more newer phones, as it essentially has all of the functions the newer phones have. Additionally, the iPhone 11 will be updated for more years, so that's even more of a reason to buy this phone.

    iPhone 13 Pro: Familiar but Incredibly Different
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2021,"







  
  
    This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well.

    Broken phone customer device is appalling
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2022,"







  
  
    Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn‚Äôt charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn‚Äôt work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over ¬£1000 and still without my money or my phone.

    I normally buy the non pro version of iPhone but prices and specification with the impending  release of the iPhone 14 changed my options.I wanted the larger version iPhone 14 but the price had rocketed to ¬£949.I was getting a slightly bigger screen but last years processor!!!The iPhone 13 Pro was available from Amazon, so I got the Pro cameras, the Pro motion display and those little extras you get with a Pro (including the sexy stainless steel for the same cash outlay ¬£949.The Pro is amazing, the extra 6 x optical zoom lens and 15 x digital zoom lens is staggering when compared to the iPhone 12 and the whole phone looks so much better.So I ended up without a bigger screen but got so much more.I bought the blue version and I love it.

    Changed product three times
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 November 2022,"







  
  
    I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

    I have just received this watch today and I love it. The watch is very light to wear and comfortable but I found it a little bit fiddly to fasten the strap. As you can see in the photos the strap is actually a very pale grey colour..which isn't that bad, although it looks white on Amazon page. The app Da Fit is so much better than Glory-fit that I've tried before, easy peasy to set up with the QR code. The watch has so many functions  not all shown in photos,. When ordering this it was priced at ¬£26.99 which I thought was a bargain. Hopefully I won't be returning this one like I have the others. I do think it deserves a better rating than 3.9 out of 5 but I guess it's early days yet for me.

    Has similar function to an apple watch for a fraction of the cost.  It does seem to disconnect a lot, but that may be a user issue as I'm not the most technical.  For my purposes, which is usually tell the time and see what my messages are without having to keep getting my phone out of my handbag, it more than suffices.  I have also used the phone function and had no issue with it.

    Comfortable watch with reasonable battery life (approx 2/52). I like how it is capable of monitoring BP, pulse and SpO2 and the other capabilities including timer. The charging cable is a bit of a pain as it can be a bit of a balancing act without losing contact with the charger if you don‚Äôt lay the watch face down.I love that I can customise the screen to a photo of my choice but I wish I could modify the positioning of the text more than currently available.The best part of this purchase was the customer service. I used the email service after the screen failed for an unknown reason on my first watch but had fallen outside the Amazon return window. I raised the issue on 31/8 and by 8/9 I had a brand new replacement on my wrist as the watch comes with a 2 year warranty.

It's super fast and easy to use and you can take some of the best pictures whilst on the go!The price point and the added extra of the ear buds were a nice touch and I now use them daily too.Also, I find the keyboard nice to use with its haptic feedback and makes typing easier and quick than most phones.

    Finalmente ci siamo
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 14 October 2023,"







  
    Da fan dei Googlefonini ho avuto praticamente tutti i Pixel usciti fino ad oggi e devo ammettere che dopo il Pixel 5 non mi hanno mai convinto per estetica, schermo e processore, quindi in concomitanza con il restyling del design e la nascita del SoC proprietario G Tensor (base Exynos Samsung). Pare che con questa serie 8 e il Tensor G3 hanno trovato la quadra.Partiamo con il display dove hanno fatto un notevole miglioramento, netto, siamo ai livelli di un Samsung s23. Colori ben tarati, nessuna tinta strana, se inclinato non soffre di blue/red shift. Luminosit√† altissima. √à migliorato tanto il display rispetto al Pixel 7.Altro miglioramento (per adesso) riguarda temperature e surriscaldamento durante l'utilizzo su rete mobile. Prime configurazioni e prime due giornate di utilizzo nessun problema nessuna criticit√†, anche l'autonomia ne guadagna e l'ho notato fin da subito (parlo sempre di utilizzo sotto rete 4g/5g), oltretutto siamo ancora al 3¬∫ giorno di commercializzazione quindi devono ancora affinare il software, e sono sicuro che migliorer√† ancora. Altro miglioramento importante: costruzione e design. Assemblato in modo eccellente, √® piu compatto e leggero, bordi leggermente pi√π sottili, display pi√π a filo con il vetro e il piccolo restyling con linee pi√π morbide (angoli arrotondati) lo aspettavo proprio, frontalmente sembra davvero un altro smartphone rispetto al Pixel 7.Ricezione ancora devo valutare per bene ma pare sia tutto nella norma, non √® ne eccellente ne problematica, se si perde la linea il riaggancio √® rapido. Audio in chiamata ottimo.Piccolo miglioramento anche per quanto riguarda il lettore impronte, funziona da subito bene, anche utilizzando una pellicola in vetro trovata d'occasione qui su Amazon (che cambier√≤ appena possibile con una clear-coat oppure una Zagg).7 anni di aggiornamenti software, roba da fare (quasi) impallidire laüçè, ma probabilmente cambierete smartphone molto prima.Aggiungo che quest'anno con la partnership Google-Uni‚Ç¨ur0 a breve si troveranno moltissime cover e accessori anche per i Google Pixel.Poi per quanto riguarda altre cose come audio degli speakers, fotocamera o feedback aptico, al momento mi sembra esattamente uguale al 7 ma l'8 ha molti pi√π margini di miglioramento per quanto riguarda la fotocamera.I difetti riscontrati per ora sono gli stessi che ho avuto con tutti gli altri modelli: ricarica abbastanza lenta (27w) che nel 2023 a 800‚Ç¨ non √® accettabile, USB Type-c 3.2 ma SENZA uscita video tramite cavo (come sempre √® bloccato da Google via software), Selfie-cam solo accettabile, gestione RAM delle app in background ancora incerta, ho fatto un test con un iphone SE 2022 e su 10 app aperte il Pixel ne ricarica 5 mentre l'iPhone nemmeno una, probabilmente Google deve sistemare qualcosina tramite aggiornamento software. Infine le memorie che ""solo"" UFS 3.1 anziche 4.0, questo per√≠ pi√π per un discorso in ottica futura.In ogni caso valuter√≤ il device nel tempo e sicuramente aggiorner√≤ la recensione.

    Ottimo smartphone ma con qualche pecca
  
  
",Reviewed in Italy on 23 October 2023,"







  
    Ho avuto in passato nexus, dopo un periodo pi√π o meno lungo con one+ ho deciso di tornare alle origini e di ritentare la strada android stock, questo sembrava il dispositivo giusto... NI!A livello di funzionalit√† nulla da dire, preso con il bundle ha un ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo, ma avviso gi√† che mi son piaciute di pi√π le pixel buds pro. Il pixel 8 va davvero bene, sia a livello hardware che ad usabilit√† generale, lo uso parecchio e in configurazione doppia sim, ma ad oggi non so se fare il reso, perch√© purtroppo mi cade su un dettaglio fin troppo fondamentale per il mio utilizzo: dalla scheda tecnica non sembra, ma la üîã dura un po troppo poco... per il mio utilizzo le 07:00 - 22:00 sono fondamentali, il telefono mi deve arrivare vivo, e faccio circa 5 ore erotte di utilizzo (mail, WhatsApp, chiamate, ricerche google, cazzeggio nei tempi morti...) non lo uso sicuramente per giocare. Detto questo mi arriva pericolosamente sotto il 10%, e con impostazioni di risparmio energetico abbastanza conservative (mi parte il risparmio energetico al 75% di batteria e tutte le app gravose sono impostate ""con limitazioni""), diciamo che da una batteria da 4600 mha e un display da 6.2 pollici speravo un po meglio, ma alla fine la giornata la faccio

    Questo Pixel 8 √® un ottimo telefono sia lato software e hardware, oltrech√© essere molto bello!Finalmente anche lo sblocco con il volto funziona anche con le app come quelle bancarie, il che √® molto comodo, e riesce ad affiancare un gi√† buono sblocco biometrico.Come ogni Pixel all'inizio presenta qualche piccolo bug, ma sono certo che con i prossimi aggiornamenti verranno sistemati tutti.Se devo trovare un neo, avrei optato per uno schermo leggermente piu grande come un 6.4""

    Small little device that slots neatly out of the way. Makes my car wireless which really works because the only place to store my phone when connected is on the qi chargers which can then overheat the phone on the long drive. Bluetooth connectivity is strong and haven‚Äôt had any sudden drop outs on the wireless car play.Sometimes the car struggles to recognise the device but I put that down to the car rather than the device itself. Also I noticed the sound quality isn‚Äôt as crisp as through the wire but when there is an element of wirelessness in play then that is understandable.Overall, really pleased with my purchase. I am about to drive down to Spain so really happy now my car is wireless

",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2023,"







  
  
    I needed a different approach to CarPlay when I got my new iPhone 15. I wanted to go wireless charging so bought my wireless CarPlay adaptor.It‚Äôs quick and easy to install and fast to pair with the phone each time you get in the vehicle.It fits away discreetly with a small 3M sticky pad. I stored mine under the shelf out of sight in my Kia.It takes around 30 seconds to initially pair the adaptor by searching for wireless devices and then pairing via the Bluetooth option alongside the wires option together.Once paired the unit effortlessly pairs automatically every time you get into the car with the last paired phone. If you require more than one phone to be paired then you will need to repair each different phone every time you get into the vehicle. Basically it only remembers one phone at a time not multiple devices.I‚Äôve had it on test for a couple of weeks now and there‚Äôs no negative change in performance over having the phone connected with a lead. The sound is just as loud and clear with no lagging in performance on music apps or maps or navigation.  Well worth the money and really is a plug and play and forget about it as it works hidden away.

I enjoyed the added features but often started driving forgetting to plug in my iPhone to the cable connection.  So I searched Amazon for a wireless solution.  This seemed to have good reviews so ordered and it arrived quickly and was so simple and quick to install with the clear instructions included.  Absolutely delighted with the unit which connects to my iPhone every time,.  Makes short journeys so much easier now as I don't have to keep plugging and unplugging my iPhone.  Connects to CarPlay in around 15 seconds and my YouTube Music is loaded within 20 seconds of starting the car.  Pretty sure that compares well to the wired option.  Got a new iPhone a few days ago and was dead easy to set it up with the unit.  Unit is small and doesn't take up much room.  Bought a MagSafe charger for the car and that works great now that I don't have a wired connection

    Simple setup and works well. I have had to disconnect it a couple of times and it is a little delayed in connecting but that is probably expected behaviour. Anyway, not having the plug in for CarPlay easily makes up for it.

    Bought this as a present for my daughter who has only ever known Iphone's & has been a joy to use. Absolutely so simple to set up by leaving your WiFi & Bluetooth on then just connect to smartbox & away you go. Even though it's early days 3 weeks & counting, connects every time no lag or flickering & most important doesn't lose the connection both on long & short journeys.

    So much better than a cable!
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2023,"







  
  
    So much more convenient than plugging in a cable constantly to use Carplay. Took a few minutes to set up with both of our phones in my wife's car and it connects just as fast as the native Wireless Carplay in my BMW. We've just dropped the adapter in the usb port in her armrest and we don't even notice it.

    Plug in and play - works every time
  
",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2023,"







  
  
    After having issues with connection via wire, i decided to bite the bullet and purchase this Bluetooth adapter. My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner. It took a minute to set up and now flawlessly connects every time within 15-30 seconds of getting in the car - sometimes before I even get in! It streams CarPlay extremely well and I've never had any issues losing signal etc. Although its only a small quality of life improvement, I'd highly recommend this product.
