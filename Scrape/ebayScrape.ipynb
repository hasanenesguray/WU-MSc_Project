      "This iPhone SE 2020 is a good replacement. The size is the same as the iPhone 6, the battery life has a modest improvement, it fits her previous phone case although the camera lens is not in exactly the same place. There is also the improvement gained from a hardware upgrade. My wife does not push the technology so for her the upgrade appears as an improvement in run-time when looking at TicTok. She also noticed an improvement in the quality of photos after I modified her phone-case so that the lens was not obscured. There are no complaints and that is all I wanted.\n",
      "This iPhone SE 2020 has a small physical size, so if you are looking for a 'phone' without a massive screen this is a good choice. The 'home' button is no longer a physical switch, it has a haptic system which simulates the 'click' and works quite well.\n",
      "Migrating from the old phone was a breeze thanks to Apple's tool which is intended to help you upgrade your phone. The thing you need to know, and I discovered this by trial and error, is that you must put your SIM into the new phone before you start the migration otherwise things do not happen.\n",
